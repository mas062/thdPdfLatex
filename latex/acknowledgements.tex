First and foremost, Knut-Andreas Lie was more than an adviser for me, whom I had
the chance and honor to work with closely and in a daily-based manner. I learned
a lot from discussions with Halvor M. Nilsen, initially my only friend in
Norway. Jan M. Nordbotten always inspired me in my works. Helge Dahle warmly helped me with every aspect of my studies. I have enjoyed working with Segrey Oladyshkin, Wolfgang Nowak, and Holger Class while spending a semester in Stuttgart University.

I would like also to acknowledge the sponsors of the MatMora project defined in the University of Bergen in partnership with SINTEF-ICT and the University of Stuttgart, and the German Research Foundation (DFG) for financial support of the project within the Cluster of Excellence in Simulation Technology (EXC310/1) at the University of Stuttgart.
