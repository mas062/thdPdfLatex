My great thanks go to Knut-Andreas Lie who supported me throughout my study. I always enjoyed discussions with Halvor M. Nilsen, who initially was my only friend in Norway. Jan M. Nordbotten always inspired me in my works. Many thanks to Helge Dahle, who supported me during my stay in Bergen. I have enjoyed working with Segrey Oladyshkin, Wolfgang Nowak, and Holger Class while spending a semester in Stuttgart University. Special thanks go to friends and family that made my life more beautiful.

I would like also to acknowledge the sponsors of the MatMora project defined in the University of Bergen in partnership with SINTEF-ICT and the University of Stuttgart, and the German Research Foundation (DFG) for financial support of the project within the Cluster of Excellence in Simulation Technology (EXC310/1) at the University of Stuttgart.
