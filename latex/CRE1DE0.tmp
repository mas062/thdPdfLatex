\label{sec:Introduction}
``We wonâ€™t have a society if we destroy the environment''

\small{-- Margaret Mead,  American cultural anthropologist, 1901-1978}
\vspace{2.5cm} 

%Climate changes resulting from the contribution of human $\mbox{CO}_2$ emissions as green-house gas has been shown by studies such as \cite{houghton2001climate}. The
%underground sequestration of the $\mbox{CO}_2$ produced from localized sources
%like power-plants and oil and gas recovery sites is proposed as a possible
%solution to reduce the rate of $\mbox{CO}_2$ emission into the atmosphere
%\cite{hitchon1999sedimentary,bradshaw2001geological}. The technology
%required to inject $\mbox{CO}_2$ is similar to what is in use in the oil, gas, and mining
%industry. However, there are some challenges that are specific to carbon storage
%operations. Primary, the temporal and spatial scales in these problems are larger.
%Secondary, the risk of leakage of stored $\mbox{CO}_2$ up to the surface via
%natural features like fractures and faults or via man-made features such as
%leakage through ill-plugged wells and broken cap-rock due to high pressure
%imposed to the system during the injection operations is a major concern. 
%
%The main objectives of carbon storage operations are to maximize the storage
%volume and the volumetric injection rate, and to minimize the risk of leakage of
%the stored $\mbox{CO}_2$. The $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage operations require multidisciplinary collaborations. The work-flow from initial phases of a project
%until end of storage operations are divided between government and private
%sector, research organizations and industry. In particular, it is the task of the research
%community to investigate the safety of $\mbox{CO}_2$ sequestration and provide
%the methodology for $\mbox{CO}_2$ fate prediction \cite{bachu2000sequestration}.
%
%Bachu \cite{bachu2000sequestration} discusses a road-map of site selection for
%geological $\mbox{CO}_2$ sequestration. He defines the process in three steps:
%to assess the general suitability of the site, to perform an inventory study on
%the source point and storage location and the operational transport issues, and
%finally to investigate the safety and assess the capacity of the storage. Issues
%about safety and storage capacity are looked at differently from the perspective
%of immediate and ultimate results. For example, when talking about the risk of
%leakage, we might consider the leakage through ill-plugged wells or fractures
%during the injection time as the immediate risk. On the other hand, leakage
%caused by plume migration long time after the injection and contamination to
%other aquifer systems are considered as ultimated risks. 
%
%To predict the fate of the injected $\mbox{CO}_2$, it is crucial to study the dynamics
%of flow in the storage medium. Dynamical study of flow includes quantification of
%acting forces in a geological heterogeneous medium as well as in solving a
%complicated system of mathematical equations. It seems convenient to replace the
%geological heterogeneous medium with an equivalent homogeneous medium to simplify the solution of the flow equations. However,
%proper modeling of geological heterogeneity is a major control on reservoir
%assessment and carbon storage studies
%\cite{eaton2006importance,bashore1993importance,melick2009incorporating,
%milliken2008effect}.
%
%In this thesis, we report a series of studies performed within a PhD program
%under the MatMora project. MatMora is a strategic project that is defined
%to address the needs of mathematical tools to develop a modeling work-flow.
%The work in this thesis is focusing on the fundamental uncertainty in geological
%description. The work is reported in a series of papers, and the objective is to perform a sensitivity analysis on a set of geological parameters used to describe the geology of
%shallow-marine depositional systems. Although the focus is on a particular
%depositional system, the procedure can be implemented for other systems of
%interest. 
%
%We start the introduction section by discussing the global warming and its
%causes, and the carbon storage as an interim proposed solution to mitigate the
%increasing level of industrial $\mbox{CO}_2$ emission to the atmosphere.
%Section~\ref{sec:MProcedure} provides the work-flow of the works reported in the
%thesis. A brief overview of literature is given and the work is discussed in
%that section. 
%
%In Section~\ref{sec:GeologicalModeling}, we review a systematic definition
%for uncertainty from the literature and after that, the geological uncertainty
%and parameters are described. Flow equations for single-phase and two-phase flow
%problems are discussed in Section \ref{sec:FlowEquations}. In Section
%\ref{sec:FlowRegimes}, various flow regimes occurring during geological storage
%of $\mbox{CO}_2$ are described briefly by discussing the force balance within
%the medium at different times. Next, we discuss the vertical averaging method
%which can be used in large aquifers to enhance the speed of simulation.
%
%The introduction to the thesis continues in Section~\ref{sec:FolowModeling} by a discussion of flow simulation scenario and assumptions taken in the work. We use a set of flow responses that monitor the performance of the operation in a typical carbon storage problem, with a special emphasis on the injection and early migration of $\mbox{CO}_2$ in the medium. Flow dynamics and a linear sensitivity analysis performed on the simulation results are discussed in this section. 
%
%Section \ref{sec:StochasticAnalysis} provides an overview on the techniques that can be used for rapid flow simulation. We use a response surface
%method to evaluate the flow responses. This proxy model is then used in a global sensitivity analysis and Monte-Carlo risk assessment process. The introduction ends by introducing the MATLAB functions used in our work-flow. 
%
%\section{Carbon storage}
%\label{sec:CarbonStorage}
%There are a number of theories that explain the causes of climate change.
%Milankovich theory \cite{foukal2006variations} relates the energy received from
%the sun to the  cyclical variation of earth orbit around the sun, and earth
%rotation around its axis. The earth orbit changes eccentricity between circular
%and elliptical. This influences the difference between earth and sun, and on its
%maximum influence can lead to about $20\%$ difference in the energy received
%from the sun. The second variation occurs in the rotation of earth around its
%plane axis. This rotation wobbles approximately every $13600~\mbox{years}$ and
%the summer solstice switches from June to January. Also, a tilt variation of
%earth rotational axis happens approximately after every $41000~\mbox{years}$.
%This can cause warmer winters and colder summers in high latitudes
%\cite{foukal2006variations}. 
%
%The solar radiation changes by a small amount of $0.1\%$~over a $11$ year cycle.
%Also on the scales of tens to thousands of years variations in the earth orbit
%result in seasonal changes and that in the past caused glacial and inter-glacial
%cycles.
%
%The theory of green house effect relates the earth climatic change to the fact
%that the long wave radiation from earth back to atmosphere is absorbed by the
%green-house gases, mainly carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane existing in
%the atmosphere. This results in trapping of heat energy and an increase in
%atmosphere temperature level (Figure~\ref{fig:grHsGs})
%\cite{foukal2006variations}.
%
%\begin{figure}
  %\centering
  %\includegraphics[width=0.65 \linewidth]{./figurer/G-H_gasses} 
  %%
  %\caption{Green-house gases act like a blanket trapping the heat received from
%the sun.}
  %\label{fig:grHsGs}
%%
%\end{figure}
%
%Human manipulations in the nature has led to approximately $100~\mbox{ppm}$ increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. Most scientists believe that we are already experiencing the global warming due to green house effects. The IPCC Second Assessment report states that the climate change in the late $19^{th}$ century is most likely due to anthropogenic causes. 
%
%Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has got a major attention in the industry and the scientific communities. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA),
%the cost of mitigating climate change by $2050$ is estimated to be $70\%$ higher
%without implementing CCS.
%
%CCS is considered as an interim solution, because it is valid due to fossil fuel
%consumption, and the long term strategy of replacing fossil fuel with renewable
%energy will terminate the validity CCS. Therefore, initiating the CCS topic has
%to be done in a reasonable fashion such that it does not slow down the research
%for renewable energy. Another concern regarding the CCS is the acceleration of
%coal and fossil fuel consumption with the excuse of availability of CCS
%technology.

  %\caption{Geological sequestration is a proposed solution for mitigating the
%industrial $\mbox{CO}_2$ emissions.}
  %\label{fig:platform}
%%
%\end{figure}
%
%
%Sequestration of CO$_2$ at the ocean floor and also in deep underground aquifers
%are the options available for permanent storage of $\mbox{CO}_2$. Large
%availability of storage places and potential for almost permanent storage makes
%the geological sequestration the most practical option (Figure
%\ref{fig:platform}). Nevertheless, this alternative is not free from economical,
%social and industrial concerns.  
%
%In the last decades, the scientific community has been putting efforts into
%convincing the public about feasibility of these operations. A fair public
%acceptance must be based on social awareness. Any plan to increase the
%acceptance level in a society starts by measuring the current knowledge level of
%that society. 
%
%The EU has conducted a survey to assess the public awareness in $12$ European
%states. This survey is published in the recent Eurobarometer report in May
%$2011$. People's awareness and acceptance of climate change and its causes, and
%the methods to avoid or mitigate the problems, in particular the CCS technology,
%was examined in the survey. The majority of European participants are either
%fairly or very well informed about causes and consequences of climate change.
%However, the awareness of CCS in between the European respondents was low. Two
%third of the participants in the survey have had not heard at all about CCS. 
%
%The same survey suggests that the overall trust in Europe in the sources of
%information regarding  CCS is best in universities and other scientific
%institutions. Governments are investing in research, not only to move toward
%industrialization of CCS, but also to make it well received by public. This
%highlights the importance of researching the storage of $\mbox{CO}_2$ and the
%way it is needed both for industrial demands and social concerns.
%
%\section{Modeling procedure}
%\label{sec:MProcedure}
%
%Predicting the fate of $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage involves identification and
%quantification of the  relevant uncertainties and risk assessment process. The
%procedure starts with a geological description and continues with modeling of
%flow in geological formations. After constructing a deterministic flow model,
%the stochastic nature of the problem is analyzed by studying the variation in
%the model outcome due to uncertainties in the system. 
%
%\begin{figure}
  %\center
  %\includegraphics[width=0.95 \linewidth]{./figurer/prc3}
  %%
  %\caption{Modeling procedure diagram.}
  %\label{fig:prc}
%%
%\end{figure}
%
%Figure \ref{fig:prc} shows the modeling work-flow implemented in the work of
%this thesis. The steps are categorized in three parts: geological uncertainty,
%flow dynamics, and stochastic analysis. The relations between steps are plotted
%by arrows in the flow-chart. In this section, we briefly describe each step.
%More details will follow in the next sections.
%
%\textbf{Uncertain parameters:} In the first step, we identify the uncertain
%parameters of the model  to study their influence in the modeling outcome. It is
%possible that our knowledge of model sensitivity to the parameters is limited.
%Then, in a conservative approach we choose larger number of parameters and by
%doing a primary sensitivity analysis with a fast technique, we filter out the
%important parameters. Herein, the focus is on the geological parameters. In
%addition, we use most of the influential parameters modeled in the SAIGUP study.
%
%\textbf{Uncertainty quantification:} After identification of the uncertain
%geological parameters, we assign a likelihood to each of the parameters. It is
%hardly possible to have a unique likelihood template that applies to every
%geological location. Thus, we note that probabilities of existence for an
%uncertain geological feature can change from place to place. The uncertainty
%enters the modeling in the form of parameter frequency histograms. The
%conventional practice is to consider an analytical distribution function to be
%assigned to the parameters. However, the sampling procedure normally ends in
%scarce frequency histograms that are difficult to fit into a unique analytical
%distribution function.
%
%\textbf{Geological description:} Geological uncertainty study is normally done
%by series of runs to measure the sensitivity of the model to the parameter
%variations. Results are valid, only if the geology used in the work-flow is
%representative of reality. The process of geological description results in a
%large number of realizations to be used in the next steps of the study.
%
%\textbf{Flow scenario design:} Herein we define the initial and boundary
%conditions of the $\mbox{CO}_2$ injection problem. Also, we specify the
%injection scenarios. Possible simplifying physical assumptions will be taken
%here. Each scenario is implemented in all geological realizations.
%
%\textbf{Law-based flow modeling:} After defining the injection problem, we
%simulate the flow dynamics in the chosen realizations. We use a two-phase flow
%model and a standard commercial simulator.
%
%
%\textbf{Data-driven flow modeling:} Modeling the flow dynamics via formulations
%of physical laws normally results in complicated equations with large degrees of
%freedom. The computational cost of solving these equations is high, in
%particular if these models are used for uncertainty related studies that require
%a large number of simulations to cover the variation in the uncertain
%parameters. 
%
%The so called data-driven methods, are mathematical functions that are specified
%by correlating a set of unknown flow attributes to their corresponding uncertain
%parameter values. These methods need to be tuned by a law-based method before
%employment. Because these methods are designed to be only dependent on the
%uncertain parameters, they are normally low in computational costs. However,
%they may exhibit the pitfall of not following the physical rules and in some
%cases produce unrealistic results. 
%
%
%\textbf{Flow responses study:} Once the simulation results are obtained from the
%flow modeling procedure, it is possible to calculate the important flow
%responses from simulation results. The fate of carbon storage and assessment of
%the operations can be inferred from these responses. Storage volume capacity and
%rate, and leakage risk are evaluated from flow responses. Responses include
%pressure distribution over time. $\mbox{CO}_2$ plume development, and other
%quantities describing the dynamics of flow in aquifer. 
%
%
%\textbf{Sensitivity and risk analysis:} The sensitivity analysis is performed
%in two ways: firstly by using three dimensional two-phase flow simulations on
%all realizations available for demonstrating the geological variability and via
%a linear gradient method. In the second method, we employ an
%approximating polynomial to perform global sensitivity analysis and
%stochastic uncertainty studies. Using  the relatively fast data-driven method,
%we perform a Monte-Carlo process on $10000$ simulation cases. 
%
%\section{Uncertainty Sources}
%\label{uncertaintySources}
%
%Sources of uncertainty can exist in every part of $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage modeling
%process. Herein, we briefly describe each of the possible contributions to the
%uncertainty in modeling within various parts.
%
%\textbf{Uncertainty in physical modeling:} We might ignore some phenomena during
%the physical modeling of $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage that can be influential in the
%flow behavior. This might happen due to lack of awareness of the phenomena or by
%underestimating the significance of it. For
%example, we might ignore the heat exchange within the system, assuming that heat
%transfer does not play an important role in the flow performance. If some
%parameters in the modeling are sensitive to the heat and change by temperature
%variations,
%the assumption to ignore heat transfer effect will introduce considerable
%uncertainty in
%the outcome of the modeling.
%
%\textbf{Mathematical formulation and numerical approximation:} A specified
%physical problem can be formulated mathematically in more than one way. The
%choice of primary unknowns to be found can change the mathematical form and
%nature of the equations. Degrees of non-linearity and coupling between unknowns
%in the equations can vary in different formulations. 
%
%Modeling $\mbox{CO}_2$ injection and migration in a realistic geological
%formation results in a complicated mathematical system that in most of the cases
%can not be solved analytically. The numerical approach to approximate the
%original mathematical system, normally introduces errors in approximation.
%Mathematical analysis can help in estimating the error or its order, but it
%might not be doable for complicated models.
%
%\textbf{Geological uncertainty:} The high costs of data acquisition and
%technical
%limitations introduce a huge amount of geological uncertainties in $\mbox{CO}_2$
%storage modeling. The injected $\mbox{CO}_2$ may travel in a large spatial scale
%and providing enough geological information and the medium attributes is a big
%challenge.
%
%\textbf{User introduced uncertainty:} These type of uncertainties are caused by
%the errors introduced by a user for her/his biased choice of modeling tools and
%interpretations of modeling results. 
%
%\section{Geological modeling}
%\label{sec:GeologicalModeling}
%
%The central part of a successful $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage fate modeling is to
%provide plenary aquifer models that depict the geological heterogeneity in a
%realistic manner. This requires having an inclusive understanding about model
%sensitivity with respect to different geological parameters and quantifications
%of geological uncertainty and its impacts on the process. 
%
%The conventional practice of geological modeling includes using geostatistical
%models. It is possible that two different heterogeneity patterns produce the
%same geostatistical model, as discussed by Caers \cite{caers2002multiple}.
%Therefore, a geostatistical model does not represent a unique reservoir image
%and if we do not include additive information in the process, we might end-up
%with an unrealistic heterogeneity
%texture\cite{caers2002multiple,eaton2006importance}. The primary  attention in
%our work has been on this issue and to provide a more realistic way of
%geological uncertainty analysis for $\mbox{CO}_2$ sequestration by including
%information of geological features and textures in the process.

\subsection{Geological description}

The geological storage of \coo requires large accommodation of subsurface volumes. Only sedimentary basins, which hold relative large pore volumes, are generally suitable for this mean. However, not all sedimentary basins are similarly appropriate for \coo sequestration.

Convergent basins along active tectonic areas pose a higher risk of \coo leakage due to volcanism, earthquakes, and active faults. Divergent basins located on the stable lithosphere are much less prone to earthquakes or other catastrophic event that can lead to accidental releases of large \coo quantities. Therefore, specific considerations must be done in selecting injecting site locations with respect to security of subsurface storage.

Sedimentary basins are composed of various lithological facies. Stratigraphic architecture and sandbody geometry control the capacity and effectiveness of \coo sequestration. As a result of various tectonic depositional and erosional process, low and high permeability rocks are accumulated on top of each other that can form stratigraphic flow-path leading to various directions and speed of subsurface flow. Three types of formations can be characterized: aquifers, aquitards, and aquicludes. 

Aquifers are high permeability strata that provide major beddings for flow transport. Good rock quality in continuous sandbodies allow for efficient \coo storage in an acceptable capacity volumes. Aquitards are made of low permeability strata that provide beddings with orders of magnitude slower flow than aquifers. Layers of aquifers and aquitards are formed by thick accumulation of sediments that undergo burial, compaction, lithification and uplift over millions of years. They can be covered by aquicludes, which are evaporative beds that are impervious to fluid flow.

Typical seal rocks include, from most ductile to most brittle : salt, anhydrite, krogen-rich shales, dense mudstone, tightly cemented sandstones, anhydrite-filled dolomite, carbonate, or silica-cemented sandstones, and cherts \cite{sneider2000seals}.

Aquifer pressure is normally close to hydrostatic, because of the conductivity within the medium that allows for pressure equilibrium over long time. High pressurized compartments can exist in highly sealed structures. The pressure of the sedimentary basin have a significant impact on its suitability for \coo storage REF.
trapping mechanism for \coo is in two main parts: stratigraphic and structural traps. Stratigraphic trapping  is primarily controlled by the geometry of depositional facies and sand body continuity. These factors control the permeability distribution within the medium that controls the efficiency of injection and storage of \coo. 

Structural heterogeneity factors include faults, folds, and fracture intensity. the dip angle of formation layers control the buoyancy forces applying on \coo plume migrating along the conductive layer. Fractures can enhance the mobility of the plume and sealing faults can provide structural traps for long term \coo storage. Anticline structures also can be a permanent trap for stored \coo.

Depositional environment varies between fluvial to marine systems. The texture and degree of sandiness of beach deposits are a function of the shore profile, typically consisting of a gently sloping formation layering in a transition from near shore to deep offshore. Deposits range from sandy, coarse grain structure near the shore, to muddy, burrowed, fine grained sand in the lower off shore. High energy near the shore that is a result of interplay between wave, fluvial, and tidal forces, filters out the larger grains in the deposition.

Therefor, near the shore contains large continuous sand bodies that have good quality rock. This is the reason for shallow-marine systems to be appropriate trap for hydrocarbons and analogously, good candidates for \coo storage.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Heterogeneities in fluvial and beach depositions. Arrow in Figure (b) shows that the deposition mass is less heterogeneous than the fluvial systems.}
\label{fig:delta}
\end{figure}

The beach facies normally are homogeneous rocks with internal heterogeneity due to tidal systems. In contrast, mixed-load fluvial that contain both mud and sand are more heterogeneous than beach systems. The presence of numerous mud drapes as a result of periodic floods, serve as barriers to fluid flow. Heterogeneity in the fluvial systems exist in multi-scale levels, from small scale variations of rock type near the river bed, to the large scale heterogeneity in fluvial channel fill sandstones and over-bank deposits. Heterogeneity also occurs within these systems in the form of muddy abandoned channel fill deposits.

In theory, we prefer a medium that allows for more lateral movement to overcome the buoyancy bypassing of the flow. Heterogeneity in the vertical direction, such as shales inter-bed barriers can serve for this and disperse the flow in the lateral direction. Structural heterogeneities can have a similar impact. In addition, splitting a large plume into smaller plumes lowers the risk of leakage of huge \coo amounts via potential breakings in the integrity of the sealing barriers, or abandoned wells.

\coo injectivity is related to sequestration capacity and effectiveness, and can be defined by the conductive cross sectional area. Stratigraphic factors that enhance injectivity are high permeability and injection interval thickness. In addition, the lateral permeability architecture can influence the injectivity quality. The lower the injectivity is, the higher will be the pressure buildup in the medium due to injection.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figurer/lateral_vertical}
\caption{Heterogeneities in the vertical and lateral direction impacts the flow direction, sweep effeciency and \coo plume size.}
\label{}
\end{figure}

Over the last two decades, there have been a large number of studies concerning the subsurface storage of \coo. Several authors investigate the efficiency of geological \coo storage based on regional data in a specific site location.

A case study from the Texas Gulf Coast investigates the sequestration capacity and efficiency in accordance to the geological heterogeneity. The study performs a site-scale assessment of applicability of geological sequestration in brine formation. Injection is considered in the Frio formation which is a sandstone-rich, high quality, overlain by a thick, regionally extensive shale in the upper Texas Gulf Coast. Migration of \coo during injection (20 years), and post-injection (40 years)is studied within different heterogeneities represented by stochastic modeling of geological sediment via petrophysical parameters. Structural heterogeneity is modeled by layers dip angle and faults at different locations. Six models are made based on regional available geological information. 

The study shows that in a homogeneous rock volume, \coo flow paths are dominated by buoyancy, bypassing much of the lateral rock volume. If the permeable rock is inter-bedded with multiple low permeability layers, the flow paths are dispersed, enhancing the lateral movements of  \coo allowing for larger percentage of contact with rock volume. The study suggests that dip angle enhances buoyancy forces and decreases storage capacity, while compartmentalization by faulting appears to increase sequestration capacity at the cost of increased pressure, and consequently, increased risk of \coo leakage.

A number of pilot sites are established worldwide to test the large scale injection of \coo in the subsurface formation. The In Salah project in Algeria is an industrial-scale injection project into a fracture-influenced, matrix-dominated sandstone formation. The reservoir matrix comprises tidal deltaic sandstone. The project benefits from relatively high level of data acquisition: wireline and LWD well logs, image logs and production and geophysical monitoring. In addition, most valuable monitoring method has been the usage of satellite air.borne radar above the injection well. Also, chemical tracers are used in the injected \coo to differentiate the natural \coo in place from the injected volumes, when the \coo breaks through other wells.

The detailed analysis highlights the geological controls on the movement and dispersion of \coo plumes. The injection is performed via a horizontal well perpendicular to the geomechanical stress field and the faults presenting in the domain. This, along with the fracture network, enhance the plume migration- about three times faster than the flow in a homogeneous domain.

Results from In Salah illustrate the value of reducing geological uncertainty by employing sufficient logging tools and monitoring techniques. 

\coo-SINK project at Ketzin Germany, is another pilot site for practicing subsurface \coo injection. The injection is performed in the Stuttgart formation that is geologically heterogeneous within an anticline structure. The Stuttgart formation is made of sandy channel facies of good rock quality alternate with muddy flood-plain-facies. A thick cap-rock section covers the Stuttgart formation.


Practically, including all details of every scale into flow simulation model is impossible. Various simplifications have been made to account for heterogeneities in modeling. Some earlier studies consider two dimensional modeling, with homogeneous or geostatistically populated permeabilities. The study in \cite{lindeberg1997escape} simulates an escape rate of \coo in a homogeneous medium similar to Utsira formation in Norway. By changing the horizontal permeability, they emphasise that the permeability of the layer beneath the cap-rock (where most of \coo injected volume accumulate due to buoyancy forces), plays an influential role in the \coo migration process. However, this study assumes no vertical heterogeneities. A layered heterogeneity is examined in \cite{van1995co}. They used a log normal distribution of permeability in a simplified two dimensional grid to account for viscous and gravity forces. Results suggest that the sweep efficiency of \coo in the porous medium is low, and heterogeneity, in particular the vertical transmissibility, can have a big impact on the storage efficiency. 

To examine the impact that the geological heterogeneity degree can have on the $\mbox{CO}_2$ sequestration modeling, \cite{flett2007heterogeneous} constructed a suite of three dimensional simulation models, with varying net to gross ratios. A radial variogram, with a shale length of 300 m, was used to
populate five models of varying degrees of net-sand-to-gross-shale ratios. The models were up-scaled, using flow-based methods, to make the computation feasible. The study concludes that formations containing shale barriers are effective in containing an injected CO2 plume within the formation and that heterogeneity serves to limit the reliance of the formation seal as the only mechanism for containment.

\subsection{Geological parameters}

From the flow modeling perspective, sources of geological uncertainty can
manifest themselves in the rock parameters that go in the flow equation such as
permeability and porosity. To represent the geological uncertainty, it is not
enough to randomize these parameters. This approach might work in simple
geological models, but it can fail to give plausible results in the realistic
heterogeneous problems with uncertain structural and depositional descriptions.

In response to the EU priorities of reducing time to first oil and of improving
overall hydrocarbon recovery efficiency, the interdisciplinary SAIGUP study was
initiated to increase the understanding of the influence of geological
uncertainties in oil field recoveries. SAIGUP stands for 'sensitivity analysis
of the impact of geological uncertainties on production forecasting in clastic
hydrocarbon reservoirs'. The context in SAIGUP is defined for shallow-marine
depositional systems. The main objective of the SAIGUP project has been to
perform a quantitative sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of
sedimentological and structural variations within geological descriptions on 
oilfield recovery estimates
\cite{howell2008sedimentological,manzocchi2008sensitivity,matthews2008assessing}. 

Six different rock types are considered in the geological modeling.  The rock properties within each facies are populated based on real data. Variations are considered in a horizontal-vertical matrix in three levels of heterogeneities, low, medium, and high, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:stratMat}. The design focused on special considerations. For example, making complex enough heterogeneities to be a plausible representative of realistic models, and producing large enough number of realizations with sufficient overlapping to be able to perform a quantitative sensitivity analysis.

Sedimentological variability is modeled in small and large scales and combined
to provide realistic variations of reservoir heterogeneities.  All models are considered in a progradational sedimentary environment. A regular grid is used for all of the realizations in two gridding resolutions, fine and coarse, and the total bulk volume is the same in all cases. Each geological realization contains about $1.5$ million cells in the fine model. Figure \ref{fig:finAct} shows the fine grid model for a selected realization with medium level of heterogeneity. A major fault in the model breaks the structure and makes large vertical depth difference in the two parts of the model (from about $1500$ m to $3000$ m).  Thickness of the model is much smaller than these depth differences. To make it easier to see the property variations on the grid in the vertical direction, we map the properties on a flat uniform geometry (Figure \ref{fig:finUnf}).

Figure \ref{fig:facies} shows the spatial distribution of the six modelled facies in the selected realization, and Figure \ref{fig:kxh} shows the histogram of lateral transmissibility within each facies and the total model in the logarithm scale. Each facies is modeled separately in some levels of upscaling starting from the lamina scales, before populating on the fine grid. Flow based upscaling techniques are used, and the suitability of the methods depends on the balance of
forces. When the medium is conductive due to high permeability, the viscous dominated steady state method is used. In the rocks with lower transmissibility where the capillary forces are dominant, the capillary equilibrium is assumed.

On the last step, the fine populated grid is mapped on to the coarse grid that is to be used for the flow solver. Since the grid size in the fine model is too expensive computationally for flow simulations, the lateral dimension is doubled in each cell while every four layers are lumped into one layer in the vertical direction. Figure \ref{fig:upsat} shows the top view of lateral transmissibility in logarithmic scale for four consecutive layers of a selected case, and their corresponding upscaled layer in the coarse grid.

%Structural aspects are modeled via fault modeling within geological description. Within the SAIGIP setup, faults are considered in different levels of intensity, orientation, and transmissibility. The orientations may vary in both lateral directions, and we consider a grid that contains faults in both directions (Figure \ref{fig:fltGrd}).

%Although these models were designed to study the impact of geological
%heterogeneity on oil recovery, they may also be used to model a scenario in
%which $\mbox{CO}_2$ is injected into an abandoned reservoir. Therefore, we have
%selected five parameters from the setup and varied these parameters by combining
%different levels for our $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage study. These features are
%lobosity, barriers, aggradation angle, progradation, and fault. In the
%following, we describe each feature briefly.
%
%
%\textbf{\textit{Lobosity}}: Lobosity is a metric for describing the interplay
%between fluvial and wave processes in a shallow-marine depositional system. As
%the river enters the mouth of the sea, the shore-line shapes where the river
%flux crash with the waves from see. The balance between the sediment supply from
%rivers and the available accommodation space in the shallow sea defines the
%shore-line shape. Sea waves smear out the shore-line, while fluvial flux from
%river makes branches into the sea. Less wave effect produces more pronounced
%lobe shapes around the river entrance into the sea. 
%
%The channels made into the sea mouth by fluvial supplies contain good quality
%rocks with relatively higher porosity and permeability and poor quality rock
%types are located between the conductive branches. Reservoir quality decreases
%with distance from the shore-face. Lobosity variation can influence the CO$_2$
%injection operation and plume distribution in the aquifer. In this study, models
%of three levels of lobosity are used: flat shoreline, one lobe and two lobes,
%see Fig.~\ref{fig:lobCauses}.

  %\caption{Lobosity levels are defined based on the shoreline shape, which is
%caused by the interplay between fluvial and wave forces.}
 %\label{fig:lobCauses}
%\end{figure}
%
%\textbf{\textit{Barriers}}: 
%Barriers are mud-draped surfaces sitting between reservoir sections that are
%caused by periodic floods in a shallow-marine depositional system. Barriers
%extend in both vertical and lateral directions and are potential significant
%barriers to
%flow.  In the SAIGUP domain used here, these barriers were modeled by defining
%areas between layers with zero transmissibility multipliers. The areal coverage
%designed in three levels: low (10\%), medium
%(50\%), and high (90\%). We use the same variations in this study, see
%Fig.~\ref{fig:barriers}.

%%
%\end{figure}
%
%\textbf{\textit{Aggradation angle}}:
%In shallow-marine systems, the sediment supply from rivers deposits in a
%spectrum of large size grains in the land side toward fine grains deep in the
%basin. Amount of deposition supplied by the river compared to the accommodation
%space that the sea provides defines the transition of different rock-types
%between the river and the sea. If the river flux or sea level
%fluctuates, the equilibrium changes into a new bedding shape based on the
%balance of these
%factors.

  %%
  %\caption{Aggradation angle levels.}
  %\label{fig:agrLvl}
%%
%\end{figure}
%
%When the river flux increases, it shifts the whole depositional system into the
%sea causing an  angle between transitional deposits that are stacked on
%eachother because of this shifting. This angle is called aggradation angle.
%Three levels of aggradation are modeled here: low, medium and
%high (Fig.~\ref{fig:agrLvl}). As we will see later, aggradation can have a major
%role in influencing the $\mbox{CO}_2$ flow direction in the medium. 
%
%\textbf{\textit{Progradation}}: 
%Progradation is the depositional-dip direction between the see and the river.
%Two types are considered here: up and down the dominant structural dip.
%Progradation combined with lobosity can influence the plume development in the
%medium, as the injected $\mbox{CO}_2$ plume migrates upward to the crest goes
%through heterogeneities(Fig.~\ref{fig:proLvl}).

%\section{Flow equations}
%\label{sec:FlowEquations}
%After introducing the parameters that make our geological model, we need to
%define the flow problem. In this section we discuss various formulations of the
%governing equations describing single and two phase flow in porous medium. We
%introduce the functionalities and axillary equations required to close the flow
%equation system. This section also includes a brief mathematical discussion on
%the flow equations. We discuss various flow regimes in the medium in the next
%section.
%
%\subsection{Single phase flow}
%
%Assume a porous domain $\Omega$ with boundary $\Gamma$ as shown in Figure
%\ref{fig:prsDmn}. We write the continuity equation in general form for a single
%phase flowing in the domain
%\cite{aavatsmark2004bevarelsesmetoder,aavatsmark2004bevarelsesmetoderHP,
%celia2011geological}:
%
%\begin{equation}
  %\mbox{Accumulation}+\mbox{In-Out Flux} = \mbox{Source/Sink}
  %\label{eq:ak}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
  %\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\phi\rho)d\tau+\int_{\Gamma}(\rho v
%\cdot n)d\sigma=\int_{\Omega}qd\tau
  %\label{eq:main}
%\end{equation}
%% \begin{tabular}{cc}
%
%In Equation \ref{eq:main}, $\phi$ is the rock porosity, $\rho$ is the fluid
%density, $v$ is the flow velocity, and $n$ is the normal vector to the boundary.
%The term $q$ denotes the mass source or sink in the system. Integrations are
%taken over arbitrary domain $\Omega$ with boundary $\Gamma$ (Figure
%\ref{fig:prsDmn}). Flow velocity is considered at the representative elementary
%volume (REV) scale for porous media \cite{bear1988dynamics}.
%
%The resistance of porous medium against flow results in a velocity which can be
%calculated from pressure and gravity gradient and fluid properties in the
%medium.
%This is governed by Darcy equation for single phase flow:
 %
%\begin{equation}
  %v=-\frac{K}{\mu}\cdot (\nabla{P}+\nabla{D}).
  %\label{eq:darcy}
%\end{equation} In Equation \ref{eq:darcy}, $K$ is the permeability of the
%medium.
%Permeability is a function of pore size distribution and connectivity and in the
%macro scale, it is a measure of medium conductivity when a fluid is flowing
%through the medium ( Figure \ref{fig:snglK}). $D$ is the gravity term that is a
%function of fluid specific gravity and elevation in vertical direction. 
%
%\begin{figure}[thb] 
  %\centering{}
  %\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./figurer/BCPB.eps}
  %\caption{Flow domain and boundaries.}
  %\label{fig:prsDmn}
%\end{figure}
%
%\begin{figure}
 %\centering{}
 %\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{./figurer/singlePerm}
 %\caption{Permeability is an idication of how easy it is for the fluids to flow
%trough the medium.}
 %\label{fig:snglK}
%\end{figure}
%
%Substituting velocity term from Equation \ref{eq:darcy} into Equation
%\ref{eq:main} gives:
%\begin{equation}
  %\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\phi\rho)d\tau-\int_{\Gamma}(\rho
%(\frac{K}{\mu}\cdot (\nabla{P}+\nabla{D})) \cdot n)d\sigma=\int_{\Omega}qd\tau.
  %\label{eq:main}
%\end{equation} As a primary unknown in Equation \ref{eq:main}, pressure depends
%upon boundary conditions as it is clear from the second term left hand side of
%Equation \ref{eq:main}. Also, any geological discontinuities in the medium
%($\gamma_i$ in Figure \ref{fig:prsDmn}) appear in Equation \ref{eq:main} through
%$K$ tensor and can influence pressure behavior in the domain.
%
%The second term in Equation \ref{eq:main} can be converted into an integration
%over domain $\Omega$, using divergence theorem resulting in the following:
%\begin{equation}
  %\int_{\Omega}[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\phi\rho)+\nabla \cdot (\rho
%v)]d\tau=\int_{\Omega}qd\tau.
  %\label{eq:div}
%\end{equation} Equation \ref{eq:div} is valid for arbitrary domain $\Omega$,
%hence the equality is valid for the integrands \textit{almost everywhere} in
%domain $\Omega$ in the \textit{general} situation:
%\begin{equation}
 %\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\phi\rho)+\nabla \cdot (\rho v)=q.
 %\label{eq:diff}
%\end{equation}
%Fluid and rock change in volume with pressure variations. These dependencies are
%defined by a parameter called total compressibility, which is approximated by a
%combination of rock and fluid compressibilities:
%\begin{equation}
  %C_{T}\approx C_{rock}+C_{fluid},
  %\label{eq:Ct}
%\end{equation} where
%\begin{equation}
  %C_{rock}=\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial P},
  %\label{eq:Cp}
%\end{equation} and
%\begin{equation}
  %C_{fluid}=\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial P}.
  %\label{eq:Cf}
%\end{equation} In Equation \ref{eq:Cp}, $C_{rock}$ can be assumed constant in
%moderate pressure changes depicting a linear relation between pressure and
%porosity. Also, Equation \ref{eq:Cf} can be expanded resulting in the following
%\cite{muskatflow}:
%\begin{equation}
 %\rho=\rho_0 (\frac{P}{P_0})^m exp[C_{fluid}(P-P_0)].
 %\label{eq:Cexp}
%\end{equation} Assuming slight compression gives \cite{sahimi2011flow}:
%\begin{equation}
 %\rho \simeq \rho_0 + C_{fluid} \rho_0 (P-P_0)
 %\label{eq:Cslg}
%\end{equation}
%
%By substituting from Equations \ref{eq:Ct}, \ref{eq:Cf}, \ref{eq:Cp}, and
%Equation \ref{eq:darcy} into Equation \ref{eq:diff}, density vanishes and by
%defining volumetric source/sink $\eta$, we have the single-phase diffusivity
%equation:
%\begin{equation}
 %C_T \frac{\partial P}{\partial t}-\nabla \cdot [\frac{K}{\mu} (\nabla P -
%\nabla D)] = \eta.
 %\label{eq:vol}
%\end{equation}
%
%\subsection{Two-phase flow}
%
%In a two-phase flow of $\mbox{CO}_2$ and water within porous media, interactions
%between phases lead to loss of energy. This introduces specific phenomena
%occurring in the pore scale that have impact on the macro scale flow
%performance.
%More complicated equation appear in modeling the two-phase flow compared to the
%single-phase problem. First we describe some of the conceptual two-phase
%phenomena in the pore scale and then we will continue by deriving the flow
%equations for two phases in the system, i.e. $\mbox{CO}_2$ and water.
%
%\begin{figure}
 %\centering{}
 %\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{./figurer/wettability.eps}
 %\caption{Wettability and interfacial tension in water-$\mbox{CO}_2$ system.}
 %\label{fig:wetting}
%\end{figure}
%
%When $\mbox{CO}_2$ and water get in contact in the pore scale, an interface
%forms between them such that the energy in the system is minimized. Water and
%$\mbox{CO}_2$ are also in contact with the porous medium and the interface
%between them forms an angle from the solid phase in the water phase (shown by
%$\theta$ in Figure \ref{fig:wetting}) that depends on their competence for
%wetting the rock. This is called wettability and the phase with the
%preference of wetting the solid phase is called the wetting phase. The other
%phase is called the non-wetting phase.  Conventionally, $\theta$ is measured
%inside the denser fluid. If $\theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$ then the denser phase is
%the wetting phase. Wettability in a porous medium depends on the fluids and the
%rock. It can have a significant influence in the phase displacement within the
%medium. For water-$\mbox{CO}_2$ system, normally water is the wetting phase. 
%
%\begin{figure}
 %\centering{}
 %\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{./figurer/K2}
  %\caption{Multi-phase flow in the pore scale.}
 %\label{fig:mphf}
%\end{figure}
%
%At very low water saturations, water covers the rock grains surface in layers
%that can go to the thickness size order of molecular films. In this
%situation the water phase is
%immobile and can not make a continuous phase moving through the porous medium.
%As water saturation in the medium increases, the layers covering the rock grains
%grow in size until the saturation exceeds a critical level, above which the
%water phase is able to flow in the medium. This saturation is called the
%critical or connate water saturation. In a water wet rock, once the
%critical water saturation
%is reached (for example, during the first deposition of sediments), it can not
%go below that level by being displaced via a non-wetting phase. Therefore, when
%we inject $\mbox{CO}_2$ into an aquifer, there will always be some residuals
%water saturation in the regions invaded by $\mbox{CO}_2$.
%
%\begin{figure} 
  %\centering{}
  %\includegraphics[width= 0.45 \linewidth]{./figurer/Kr}
  %\caption{Two-phase flow and relative permeability.}
  %\label{fig:kr}
%\end{figure}
%
%As a non-wetting phase, $\mbox{CO}_2$ flows in the middle part of the pore space
%as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mphf}. If $\mbox{CO}_2$ saturation decreases in the
%medium, it reaches a critical level under which it can not make a continuous
%phase flowing through the pore-network. Tiny drops of $\mbox{CO}_2$ are trapped
%in the middle of the pore space and only very large pressure difference across
%the pore can move it out of the pore. This level of $\mbox{CO}_2$ saturation  is
%called the residual saturation. Higher residual saturation is more interesting
%for the purpose of immobilizing more volumes of injected $\mbox{CO}_2$ in the
%aquifer, which reduces the risk of $\mbox{CO}_2$ leaking through any breakings
%in the geological formation and channeling toward surface.
%
%Relative ease for the phase to flow within the medium is described by
%the relative
%permeability parameter. Relative permeability is a function of wettability and
%phase saturation. High phase saturation indicates a higher space available for
%the phase to flow through that space. A sample of $\mbox{CO}_2$-water relative
%permeability functions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:kr}. A library of relative
%permeability curves for $\mbox{CO}_2$-water system for various rock-types is
%available at \cite{krLib}.
%
%The difference in surface tension between water and $\mbox{CO}_2$ causes a
%pressure acting on the interface of the two fluids. This pressure is called
%capillary pressure. In addition, capillary pressure depends on the geometry of
%pores. Since the pore geometry is very irregular, it is more convenient to use
%simpler geometry to drive the concept of capillary pressure. Therefore,
%experimental work in the laboratory is required to specify the capillary
%pressure functionality in a special case. 
%
%Assuming a geometry of pipe to represent a pore structure, after balancing the
%forces in the pore-system capillary pressure can be written in the following
%form:
%
%\begin{equation}
 %P_c=\frac{2\sigma}{r}cos\theta,
 %\label{eq:pcS}
%\end{equation} where $\sigma$ is the interfacial tension, $\theta$ is the angle
%between the interface and the solid phase, and r is the radius of the pore.
%
%Capillary pressure is a jump in phase pressure across the interface of the two
%phases. Therefore, we can relate it to the phase pressures:
%\begin{equation}
 %P_c=P_{nw}-P_w.
 %\label{eq:pcJump}
%\end{equation} Here, $P_{nw}$ is the non-wetting phase pressure and $P_w$ is the
%wetting phase pressure. 
%
%
%\begin{figure} 
  %\centering{}
  %\includegraphics[width= 0.45 \linewidth]{./figurer/Pc}
  %\caption{Capillary pressure can be expressed as a function of wetting
%saturation. The plot is a typical curve of capillary pressure function with a
%maximum of $P_{c\mbox{max}}$}
  %\label{fig:pc}
%\end{figure}
%
%Capillary pressure can be expressed in an empirical relation as a function of
%wetting phase saturation. Lower capillary pressure is expected for higher
%wetting saturations, and capillary pressure values go up for lower wetting
%saturations (Figure \ref{fig:pc}). 
%
%Assume hydrostatic equilibrium for a porous domain in which water and
%$\mbox{CO}_2$ are segregated due to buoyancy effect.  If capillary forces
%are considerable in the domain, the sharp interface between water and
%$\mbox{CO}_2$ in the macro scale will be replaced by a transition zone with a
%spectrum of saturations between phases (Figure \ref{fig:TZ}). Due to the
%hydrostatic equilibrium, phase pressure at each depth can be related to the
%hydrostatic pressure of that phase:
%\begin{equation}
 %P_w=\rho_wgz
 %\label{eq:rghw},
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
 %P_{\mbox{co}_2}=\rho_{\mbox{co}_2}gz
 %\label{eq:rghc}.
%\end{equation} Having the phase pressure, capillary pressure can be calculated
%by
%Equation  \ref{eq:pcJump}. As capillary pressure is a function of wetting
%saturation, the phase saturations can be back-calculated from this functionality
%and the phase saturation distribution over the medium can be found (Figure
%\ref{fig:PC}):
%\begin{equation}
 %S_w = P_c^{-1}(S_w).
 %\label{eq:pc-1}
%\end{equation}
%
%

%
%
%
%We can derive mass and momentum balance for two-phase flow, similar to what we
%have seen for single-phase flow. The equations must be written for each phase.
%In
%Equation \ref{eq:main}, the accumulation term must be considered only for one
%phase mass calculated by multiplying the total accumulation mass by phase
%saturation ($ S_{\alpha}$). Also the velocity is the phase velocity
%$v_{\alpha}$, and the source/sink term must be written for the phase mass rate
%$q_{\alpha}$.
%
%For phase $\alpha=\{water, \mbox{CO}_2\},$ we have:
%\begin{equation}
  %\int_{\Omega}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\phi\rho_{\alpha}
%S_{\alpha})d\tau+\int_{\Gamma}(\rho_{\alpha} v_{\alpha} \cdot
%n)d\sigma=\int_{\Omega}qd\tau.
  %\label{eq:2phs}
%\end{equation} Darcy equation for two phases $\alpha=\{water, \mbox{CO}_2\}$
%can be written in the following form: 
%\begin{equation}
  %v_{\alpha}=-\frac{K_{e\alpha}}{\mu_{\alpha}}\cdot
%(\nabla{P_{\alpha}}+\nabla{D_{\alpha}}).
  %\label{eq:D2phs}
%\end{equation} Here, $K_{e\alpha}$ is the effective permeability for phase
%$\alpha$ and can be calculated from:
%\begin{equation}
 %K_{e\alpha}=K_{abs}K_{r\alpha},
 %\label{eq:Ke}
%\end{equation} where $K_{abs}$ is the absolute rock permeability and
%$K_{r\alpha}$ is the relative permeability of phase $\alpha$. $P_{\alpha}$ is
%the phase pressure and $D_{\alpha}$ is the gravity term for the phase specific
%gravity.
%
%
%
%Similar to Equation \ref{eq:diff}, differential form of mass balance equation
%for each of phases $\alpha=\{water,\mbox{CO}_2\}$ is as follows:
%\begin{equation}
 %\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\phi\rho_{\alpha}S_{\alpha})+\nabla \cdot
%(\rho_{\alpha} v_{\alpha})=q_{\alpha}.
 %\label{eq:dif2p}
%\end{equation}
 %In this equation, $q_{\alpha}$ is the source/sink mass rate for phase $\alpha$.
%
 %The phase saturations are related by the following equation:
%\begin{equation}
  %S_{water}+S_{co_2} = 1.
   %\label{eq:sat}
%\end{equation} Fluid properties change by pressure and temperature. Density is
%mainly a function of pressure and viscosity depends upon temperature. These
%functionalities, called by convention equation of state (EOS), must be coupled
%to the system to honor fluid attribute variability
%\cite{greenwood1969compressibility,duan2006equation}. 
  %
%Mass exchange between phases may happen leading to change in composition. That
%also influences the fluid properties. In the immiscible fluids, the mass
%exchange can be in small
%order leading to slight changes in fluid properties. That can be modeled in a
%linear functionalities with respect to pressure and temperature. 
 %
%Extensive mass exchange between phases results in more nonlinear fluid property
%variations that require a detailed equation of state. Also for highly miscible
%fluids and high mass transfer between phases, it might be better to write mass
%and momentum balance equations for components within phases in addition to phase
%equations.
 %
%There are number of approaches to formulate the primary unknowns in the system
%of
%flow equations. The direct way is to replace phase velocities from Equation
%\ref{eq:D2phs} into Equation \ref{eq:dif2p}, leaving the phase pressures and
%water saturation as the primary unknowns. This ends in a set of strongly coupled
%equations. 
 %
%A popular approach for formulating the set of flow equations is the fractional
%flow method \cite{binning1999practical}. In this method the total multiphase
%flow problem is treated as a
%single-phase flux of multi-phase mixture. Therefore, individual phases are
%described as a function of total flow. This leads to separate equations for
%pressure and saturation. 
 %
%Pressure and saturation are defined for the total flow either global or pseudo
%globally and relate to the phase pressure and saturation with auxiliary
%equations. The fractional flow approach keeps the governing equations in the
%form of single flow equations, and numerical schemes for single-phase flow can
%be revised into efficient schemes for multi-phase problems.
 %
%Pressure and saturation equations have different mathematical nature: pressure
%has a diffusive character of an elliptical nature, which is numerically more
%stable than the saturation equation. Saturation equation is of
%convection-diffusion form with hyperbolic character in the convection part. The
%convection operator in saturation equation can be highly non-linear due to
%strong coupling of saturation and phase velocity. This nonlinearity can lead to
%shocks and discontinuities in the saturation solution.
 %
%As an example of fractional flow formulation, global pressure $P_t$ is defined
%based on phase pressures:
 %
%\begin{equation}
 %P_t=\frac{1}{2} (P_W+P_{CO2})-\int^{Sw}_{S_w
%\mid_{P_c=0}}(f_w-\frac{1}{2}){P'}_c(S_w)dS_w,
 %\label{eq:GP}
%\end{equation} where water fractional flow $f_w$ is defined as:
%\begin{equation}
 %f_w(S_w)=\frac{\frac{K_{rw}}{\mu_w}}{\frac{K_{rw}}{\mu_co_2}+\frac{K_{rco_2}}{
%\mu_co_2}}.
 %\label{eq:fw}
%\end{equation} The total velocity is defined as:
%\begin{equation}
 %v_t=v_w+v_{co_2}.
 %\label{eq:VT}
%\end{equation}If capillary and gravity effects are negligible, saturation
%equation can be solved analytically, e.g. via Buckley-Leverett technique, or
%method of characteristics.

%\section{Flow regimes}
%\label{sec:FlowRegimes}
%
%A major part of our studies includes modeling physical phenomena occurring
%within
%flow through porous media. Various phenomena occurs during a complete sequence
%of $\mbox{CO}_2$ sequestration. During injection the forces imposed by injector
%dominate the flow behavior in a region around the injector. When $\mbox{CO}_2$
%plumes develop in a thin layer moving along the stratigraphical structure, a
%large interface between water and $\mbox{CO}_2$ enhances the diffusion phenomena
%and lets more $\mbox{CO}_2$ to be dissolved into water. Convection of water with
%dissolved $\mbox{CO}_2$ into the initial water in place leads to complicated
%flow regimes.
%
%The injected $\mbox{CO}_2$ undergoes various stages until it is stored
%underground. We consider two stages in our studies: injection ( and early
%migration), and long term migration. Many forces act on flow within medium, each
%of which requires a set of modeling parameters. Simplifying assumptions for flow
%modeling can be justified at each stage with relevance to dominating forces in
%the medium.
%
%The following can be recognized as forces acting on the medium in the scale at
%which Darcy velocity is defined:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Forces due to pressure gradient, mostly imposed by injectors ( and/or
%producing wells)
%\item Gravity, due to buoyancy with density contrast between flowing phases.
%Gravity acts in the vertical direction.
%\item Capillary forces, due to interfacial tensions.
%\item Hysteresis, due to sequencing of imbibition and drainage during flow in
%the porous medium.
%\item Convection forces, due to gradient of density in one phase.
%\item Diffusion, due to concentration gradient of one component.
%\item Reaction, due to chemical reaction between phases and rock.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Modeling all forces acting on porous media is not practical, and we need to look
%at each flow regime separately by neglecting some forces that have a minor role.
%Herein, we discuss main forces during injection and within long term migration.
%
%
%\subsection{Injection and early migration}
%
%Injection of $\mbox{CO}_2$ in the underground happens by forcing $\mbox{CO}_2$
%mass through injector into the medium. This pose a pressure gradient around the
%injector causing flow within the near bore region. Some authors call the force
%due to pressure difference `viscous force', since viscosity has an important
%role in transferring the stress due to pressure difference in the porous medium
%resulting in fluid mobility. We use the same term throughout this thesis. 
%
%Viscous and gravity forces are the two major forces acting on the region around
%injector during injection. Depending on medium-fluid properties and distance
%from injection point, force balance changes. Gravity causes rapid phase
%separation resulting in upward movement of $\mbox{CO}_2$. Gravity forces
%dominate two-phase regions far from injector with lower viscous flow velocity
%compared to near well locations, where the flow velocity is high. At each place
%in the medium, a force balance results in a total force vector that may cause
%flow in a particular direction ( Figure \ref{fig:injF}).
%
%Attempts in the literature on evaluating force interplay during a multiphase
%flow regime incorporating injection in the porous medium, employ sensitivity
%analysis on flow attribute such as flow velocity and pressure. Many authors try
%devising an analytical solution to the fairly simplified flow equations that are
%reduced by justified assumptions and are applicable to the problem
%\cite{fayers1959effect,dong1999effect,nordbotten2005injection,
%yortsos1983analytical,rapoport1953properties,farajzadeh2011analytical,
%yang1992analytical,chen1990integral,bentsen1993effect}. Utilizing analytical
%solutions gives the flexibility of examining a wide range of parameter
%variations within the model, enjoying a fast evaluation of the
%corresponding flow behavior. Semi-analytical and numerical sensitivity analysis
%are also vastly performed in the literature to involve more physical modeling
%features in the flow performance
%evaluations\cite{rosado2007analysis,allen1986theoretical,alkan2010impact}.
%
%
%The flow equations can be normalized to a dimensionless version that is used in
%many studies discussing the capillary and gravity influence on the flow.
%Herein, we give the method reported in \cite{fayers1959effect}. If we assume an
%incompressible flow in one dimensional space for a location in domain $\Omega$
%without any source/sink, Equation \ref{eq:dif2p} reduces to the following for
%the wetting phase:
%
 %\begin{equation}
  %\phi \frac{\partial s_{w}}{\partial t}+ \frac {\partial v_w} {\partial x}=0,
  %\label{eq:2p1d}
 %\end{equation} in the $x$ spatial dimension and Darcy equation for one
%dimension
%flow becomes:
 %\begin{equation}
  %v_w=-K\frac{k_{rw}}{\mu_w}(\frac{\partial P_w}{\partial t} + \rho_w g z).
  %\label{eq:D1d}
 %\end{equation} Here, z is the elevation of flow and g is the gravitational
%acceleration. The system is closed by Equations \ref{eq:sat} and \ref{eq:pcJump}
%. We can define the dimensionless variables as follows:
 %\begin{equation}
  %X^*=\frac{x}{L};T^*=\frac{tv_t}{L\phi};\mbox{ and }P^*_c=\frac{p_c}{\pi_c},
  %\label{eq:var*}
 %\end{equation} where $L$ is a length constant in the problem, and $\pi_c$ is a
%capillary pressure normalizing constant. After reformulating Equation
%\ref{eq:2p1d}, fractional flow can be written in the following form:
 %\begin{equation}
  %f_w=G(S_w)+C(S_w)\frac{S_w}{X^*},
 %\end{equation} where $S_w$ is the normalized wetting phase saturation, $G$ is
%the gravity contribution, and $C$ is the capillary contribution to
%the flow. The gravity and capillary contributions, $G$ and $C$, are expressed
%by quantities relative to the viscous force \cite{hadley1956theoretical} and we
%have:
 %\begin{equation}
  %G(S_w)=F_w(1-N_Gk_{rnw}),
  %\label{eq:GrCont}
 %\end{equation}
 %\begin{equation}
  %C(S_w)=N_{nw}F_wk_{rnw}\frac{dP_{c}}{dS_w},
  %\label{eq:PcCont}
 %\end{equation} wherein: 
 %\begin{equation}
  %F_w=(1+\frac{k_{rnw}}{\mu_{nw}}\frac{\mu_w}{k_{rw}})^{-1},
  %\label{eq:Fn}
 %\end{equation}
 %\begin{equation}
  %N_c=\frac{k\pi_c}{\mu_{nw}Lv_t},
  %\label{eq:Nc}
 %\end{equation}
 %\begin{equation}
  %N_G=(k\frac{k(\rho_w-\rho_{nw})gz}{\mu_{nw}v_t}).
  %\label{eq:Fn}
 %\end{equation} Having these definitions, Equation \ref{eq:2p1d} reshapes into:
 %\begin{equation}
  %\frac{\partial S_w}{\partial T^*}+\frac{dG(S_w)}{dS_w}\frac{\partial
%S_w}{\partial X^*}+\frac{\partial}{\partial X^*}\left( C(S_w)\frac{\partial
%S_w}{\partial X^*}\right)=0.
  %\label{eq:2p1dN}
 %\end{equation} Applying specific type of capillary pressure and relative
%permeability function may lead to simplified forms of Equation \ref{eq:2p1dN}
%with the possibility of having an analytical
%solution\cite{yortsos1983analytical}. 
%
%Some important conclusions in the literature from sensitivity studies on
%capillary, gravity and viscous forces are summarized here and inferred for
%$\mbox{CO}_2$ injection application:
%
%\begin{itemize}
 %\item The gravity and capillary pressure will only influence the flow speed
%significantly for slow displacement rates. Therefor, around the injection point
%where normally fluids are flowing relatively with a high speed, the viscous
%forces
%are dominant.
 %
 %\item If capillary is of any significance, ignoring capillary forces in
%modeling the injection of $\mbox{CO}_2$ results in a pessimistic $\mbox{CO}_2$
%sweep efficiency. Capillary helps in the spreading of $\mbox{CO}_2$ in the
%frontal $\mbox{CO}_2$-water interface.
 %
 %\item Less capillary forces in the porous medium, allows more space for
%$\mbox{CO}_2$. This in the macro scale enhances the density segregation due to
%gravity forces.
%\end{itemize}
%
%The main focus in the series of work in this thesis has been to assess the flow
%influence by heterogeneity during injection time and early $\mbox{CO}_2$
%migration. For $\mbox{CO}_2$ injection problems, one objective is to maximize
%the rate of injection and aligned with that we use relatively high injection
%rates in our studies. Therefore, we did not include capillarity forces for
%modeling the high displacement rates within heterogeneities which can be
%justified by the results in the literature.

%\subsection{Long term migration}
%
%The injected $\mbox{CO}_2$ volume in the geological formation will travel below
%the sealing cap by buoyancy forces due to the density difference between water
%and $\mbox{CO}_2$. One concern is to have it stored safely, and the mobile
%$\mbox{CO}_2$ is at risk of leaking through any imperfections in the sealing
%layers and abandoned wells. Molecular diffusion occurs in the interface of water
%and $\mbox{CO}_2$ and this mass transfer from $\mbox{CO}_2$ plume into water
%increases the water density. Transition form of $\mbox{CO}_2$ from mobile phase
%into water with dissolved $\mbox{CO}_2$ is helping the safe storage of
%$\mbox{CO}_2$: the heavier water with dissolved $\mbox{CO}_2$ has the tendency
%of moving downward. Time scale for the convective mixing is of the order of
%several hundreds years (Table \ref{tab:tscl}). Yet, this is not the end and   the
%dissolved $\mbox{CO}_2$ can react with the porous medium ending up in a solid
%phase and it can be stored permanently in a process called mineral trapping.
%This is an 
%extremely slow process and it can long to even hundreds of thousands of years
%\cite{gunter1997aquifer}.
%
%Mixing of $\mbox{CO}_2$ and water in the long term happens through phases in
%different time scales and with various physical phenomena. Diffusion of
%$\mbox{CO}_2$ in water continues and the layer of water with dissolved
%$\mbox{CO}_2$
%builds up below the $\mbox{CO}_2$ plume until it forms heavy parts convecting in
%the form of unstable fingers, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:migF}.
%
%The onset time for the convective mixing is important in terms of storage
%safety. This time depends on the Rayleigh number in the medium:
%
%\begin{equation}
 %Ra = \frac{Kg\Delta \rho H}{D_c \phi \mu}.
 %\label{Ra}
%\end{equation} Here, $\Delta \rho$ is the density difference between water and
%$\mbox{CO}_2$ phases and $D_c$ is the diffusion coefficient of $\mbox{CO}_2$
%into water phase. The higher density sitting on top of lower density makes an
%unstable system and the medium must have a minimum Rayleigh number in order to
%have a growing instability for a small perturbation in the medium.
%Heterogeneities in the medium can initiate perturbations, reducing the
%instability onset time \cite{hassanzadeh2005modelling,elenius2012time}.
%Therefore, heterogeneity is an important factor that must be considered when we
%are choosing an aquifer for $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage.
%
%Capillary fringe in the plume can enhance the convective mixing onset. It can
%speed up the process up to five times \cite{eleniuseffects}.
%
%The flow equations for convective mixing are a set of mass and momentum balance
%for component $c=\{\mbox{Water},\mbox{CO}_2\}$ within phase
%$\alpha=\{\mbox{Wetting},\mbox{Non-Wetting}\}$:
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \underset{\alpha}{\sum}\phi S_\alpha \rho_\alpha
%X_{\alpha}^c + \nabla \cdot \underset{\alpha}{\sum} \rho_\alpha X_{\alpha}^c
%v_\alpha = 0,   
%%  \phi\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}+ \left[\nabla c v_c -D_c \nabla c \right],
 %\label{eq:massCo2}
%\end{equation} and 
%\begin{equation}
 %v_\alpha = -\frac{k_{r_\alpha}K}{\mu_\alpha} \left[  \nabla
%P_\alpha-\rho_\alpha g z \right].
 %\label{eq:darcyCo2}
%\end{equation} where $X_{\alpha}^c$ is the mole fraction of
%component $\mbox{c}$ in phase $\alpha$ \cite{elenius2010co2}.

%\section{Vertical averaging}
%
%In this section we discuss the common approach used in modeling the migration
%of $\mbox{CO}_2$ in large scale aquifers. This is a specific type of multi-scale
%modeling, at which we work with two models with two and three
%dimensions. A $2\mbox{D}$ model is extracted from the corresponding $3\mbox{D}$ 
%model to reduce the computation costs and in some cases the accuracy can be
%enhanced by reducing the numerical diffusion as we will discuss here.
%
%Spatial gradients of flux and pressure appear in the the flow equations can be
%decomposed into lateral and vertical components. For a three dimensional
%problem with the set of unit vectors
%$\{\overrightarrow{i},\overrightarrow{j},\overrightarrow{k}\}$, the gradient
%operator can be written as the following:
%\begin{equation}
    %\nabla = \nabla_{\ell} + \nabla_{\\v},
    %\label{eq:grd}
%\end{equation} where:
%\begin{equation}
    %\nabla = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\overrightarrow{i} +
%\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\overrightarrow{j} +
%\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\overrightarrow{k},
    %\label{eq:grdc}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
    %\nabla_{\ell} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\overrightarrow{i} +
%\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\overrightarrow{j},
    %\label{eq:grdpllc}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
    %\nabla_{\\v} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\overrightarrow{k}.
    %\label{eq:grdvrtc}
%\end{equation} $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the location space components in the three
%directions.
%
%
%The geological formation tops are not necessarily oriented horizontally, but
%they
%are normally close to horizontal. In $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage problems the lateral
%scale is
%orders of magnitude larger than the vertical direction. Therefore, the
%variations in the vertical direction are relatively negligible and for a
%quantity of interest $\Psi$ we have:
%
%\begin{equation}
 %\int_{A}\nabla\Psi d\tau >> \int_{\varsigma}\nabla\Psi dz, 
 %\label{eq:intPsi}
%\end{equation} where $A$ is an arbitrary horizontal surface in the model and
%$\varsigma$ is the vertical interval of the domain. Hence, with large lateral
%scales we can consider average values across the vertical direction for
%parameters and variables in the flow equations. This reduces the problem from
%$3\mbox{D}$ to $2\mbox{D}$. In this case we need to relate the parameters in
%the two dimensional and three dimensional problems. If this relation is not
%extremely non-linear the flow solutions can be obtained considerably faster on
%a two dimensional problem.
%
%In a distance from the injection point, vertical equilibrium assumption is
%applicable. The density difference between water and $\mbox{CO}_2$ results in a
%rapid
%segregation of the two phases. A layer of $\mbox{CO}_2$ sits on top of water
%table and in
%the presence of considerable capillary forces a capillary transition zone forms
%between water and $\mbox{CO}_2$ zones (Figure \ref{fig:VC}).
%
%The vertical equilibrium assumption facilitates the flow equation averaging
%across the vertical direction $\varsigma$. The phase distribution can be
%calculated from the volume calculations and capillary inverse function for the
%transition zone as mentioned in \ref{sec:FlowEquations}. Phase pressure
%variation versus depth follows the hydrostatic gravitational gradient for each
%phase.
%
%The two dimensional version of flow equation can be written in the following
%form, assuming incompressible fluids \cite{moll2011field,celia2011geological}:
%
%\begin{equation}
 %\tilde{\phi}\frac{\partial \tilde{S}_{\alpha}}{\partial
%t}-\nabla_{\ell}\cdot \tilde{v_{\alpha}}=\tilde{\eta}_{\alpha},
%\label{eq:cont_}
%\end{equation} which follows by two dimensional Darcy equation:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\tilde{v}_{\alpha}=-\tilde{K}\tilde{\lambda}_{\alpha}(\nabla_{\ell}
%\tilde{P}_{\alpha}-\tilde{\rho}_{\alpha}\tilde{g}). 
%\label{eq:Darcy_}
%\end{equation}Herein, tilde sign denotes the two dimensional parameter or
%variable that is the vertically averaged of corresponding parameters and
%variables in the three dimensional problem. The averaging over vertical
%direction care defined in the following:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\tilde{\phi}=\frac{1}{H}\int_0^H\phi dz,
%\label{eq:phi_}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\tilde{K}=\frac{1}{H}\int_0^H K dz,
%\label{eq:K_}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\tilde{\lambda_{\alpha}}=\frac{1}{H}K^{-1}\int_0^HK\lambda_{\alpha} dz.
%\label{eq:lambda_}
%\end{equation} Note that $\tilde\lambda_\alpha$ is a tensor, because it is
%defined such that the $2\mbox{D}$ Darcy equation is consistent with the
%$3\mbox{D}$ Darcy equation. The variables in the $2\mbox{D}$ equations are
%defined in the following:
%\begin{equation}
%\tilde{v}_\alpha=\frac{1}{H}\int_0^H v_\alpha dz,
%\label{eq:v_}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\tilde{s}_\alpha=\frac{1}{\tilde{\phi}H}\int_0^H \phi s_\alpha dz,
%\label{eq:s_}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\tilde{P}_\alpha=p_{\alpha}(z_D),
%\label{eq:p_}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\tilde{\eta}_\alpha=\frac{1}{H}\int_0^H \eta_\alpha dz.
%\label{eq:eta_}
%\end{equation} The hydrostatic equilibrium results in a constant phase pressure
%gradient over the vertical direction. Therefor, the phase pressure at any datum
%depth $z_D$ in the medium can be used into the $2\mbox{D}$ flow equations.

%\end{figure}
%
%
%Accuracy of vertical averaging approach within $\mbox{CO}_2$ storage context has
%been
%examined in many works in the literature
%\cite{moll2011field,lie2010accurate,class2009benchmark,grayderivation}. It has
%been shown that vertical averaging is applicable to large scale $\mbox{CO}_2$
%studies. The numerical aspects and speed up of the method compared to three
%dimensional problem are studied in
%\cite{ligaarden2010numerical,grayderivation}, where a second order
%speedup is reported. Lie et al. \cite{lie2010accurate} have shown the
%influence of vertical discretization in the three dimensional models which can
%fail in low resolutions to capture the thin layer of $\mbox{CO}_2$ plume
%migrating beneath the top sealing surface in the formation. The vertical
%averaging approach can handle this issue by considering the water and
%$\mbox{CO}_2$ interface in calculating the vertically averaged parameters in the
%model. A comparison between three and two dimensional models has been done on
%various aspects in \cite{moll2011field}.
%
%The influence of topography in modeling the $\mbox{CO}_2$ migration
%and estimating the storage fate has been shown in
%\cite{syversveenstudy,grayderivation} by examining different geometries and
%heterogeneities in the domain. These conclusions suggest that the significance
%of the model top surface is more than the small order flow in the model vertical
%thickness.
%
%The studies reported in this thesis concern the flow near injector and early
%times of plume development. Therefore vertical equilibrium would benefit larger
%scales with big portion of model in vertical equilibrium. We do our flow
%modeling by including the three dimensions and for the quantitative uncertainty
%analysis we employ a polynomial approximation (Section
%\ref{sec:StochasticAnalysis}).
%
%\section{Flow modeling}
%\label{sec:FolowModeling}
%
%We use a standard porous media simulator to solve the flow equations in the
%medium. The solution is based on finite difference method and the following
%assumptions are taken:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
  %\item Two compressible phases are considered in the medium: water and super
%critical ${CO}_2$.
  %\item No mass exchange occurs between the two considered phases.
  %\item No heat exchange is considered.
 %
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{Numerical scheme}
%
%The employed simulator uses two-point finite difference scheme to solve
%Equation \ref{eq:dif2p} on a Cartesian grid. The Darcy equation for two-phases
%can be written
%in a difference. This makes the flow equation into cell $\mbox{a}$ from the
%neighboring cell $\mbox{b}$:
%\begin{equation}
 %F_{ab\alpha}=T_{ab}M_{a\alpha}\Delta \psi_{\alpha}.
%\label{eq:eclF}
%\end{equation} Here, $T_{ab}$ is the transmissibility of medium between the two
%cells. $M_{a\alpha}$ is the mobility of phase $\alpha$ that is taken upstream of
%the flow from cell $\mbox{a}$, and $\Delta \psi_{\alpha}$ is the pressure and
%gravity term difference between two cell centers. 
%
%
%\begin{figure}
 %\centering{}
 %\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{./figurer/trans.eps}
 %\caption{Transmissibility calculation for two cells $\mbox{a}$ and $\mbox{b}$.}
 %\label{fig:tran}
%\end{figure}
%
%Transmissibility for two neighboring cells (i.e., sharing a face area, see
%Figure \ref{fig:tran}) is
%calculated by harmonic average of transmissibilities from the center of each
%cell to the center of the cells mutual face within that cell:
%\begin{equation}
 %T_{ab}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{T_a}+\frac{1}{T_b}}.
 %\label{eq:Thav}
%\end{equation} Each half transmissibility is calculated by an inner product
%between the permeability of the cell $K_a $, the mutual area between cells
%$A_{ab}$, and the distance from cell center to the mutual face center $d_a$:
%\begin{equation}
  %T_a = K_a \cdot d_a \cdot A_{ab}.
  %\label{eq:tran}
%\end{equation}
%
%Mobility term in Equation \ref{eq:eclF} is defined as follows:
%\begin{equation}
 %M_{a\alpha}=\frac{k_{r\alpha}}{B_\alpha \mu_\alpha},
 %\label{eq:mob}
%\end{equation} where $k_{r\alpha}$ is the relative permeability of phase
%$\alpha$, $\mu_\alpha$ is the viscosity of phase $\alpha$, and $B_\alpha$ is the
%formation volume factor of phase $\alpha$ which is defined as :
%\begin{equation}
 %B_\alpha=\frac{\mbox{Volume at surface condition}}{\mbox{Volume at formation
%condition}}=\frac{V_{s\alpha}}{V_{r\alpha}}.  
%\end{equation}Formation volume factor definition is connected to compressibility
%of the fluid to change volume at surface and in the geological formation
%condition, but it is defined in this way in the simulator to honor cases where a
%fluid like oil loses its dissolved gas while being produced at surface pressure.
%Since we assume no mass exchange between phases in our study, here the formation
%volume factor works like compressibility of the fluid. Formation volume factor
%is a function of pressure.
%
%Slight compressibility is considered for phases in our study, and phase density
%is defined as a function of pressure:
%\begin{equation}
 %\rho_\alpha(P) =\frac{\rho_{0\alpha}}{B_\alpha(P)}.
 %\label{eq:rho}
%\end{equation} Here, $\rho_{0\alpha}$ is the density of phase $\alpha$ at
%surface condition.

%Wells are defined as source or sink in Equation \ref{eq:dif2p}. In reality wells
%are a void space drilled in the porous medium and the flow into the

%goes through a pressure change that must be modeled separately from the porous

%Figure \ref{fig:WM} shows a schematic pressure distribution around the
%injector. The well radius is much smaller than the simulation cell containing
%the well and the pressure in the bottom-hole is different than the cell
%pressure. The well bottom-hole pressure can be related to the cell pressure
%containing the well by a separate approximation that can be coupled with the
%flow equations in the grid model. Flow equation for phase $\alpha$ between the
%cell center and the well for an injector is written as follows:
%
%\begin{equation}
 %\eta_{\alpha}=T_w\cdot M_{\alpha}\cdot [P_w-P_{\mbox{i}}].
 %\label{eq:WFLW}
%\end{equation} $\eta_{\alpha}$ is the volumetric injection rate of phase
%$\alpha$, $P_w$ is the injector bottom-hole pressure, $P_{\mbox{i}}$ is the
%cell pressure, $T_{w}$ is the transmissibility between the cell and the
%injection well-bore, and $M_\alpha$ is the mobility of injection flow into the
%cell. 
%
%A region can be assumed by a radius $r_e$ at which the
%pressure is equal to the cell pressure. Approximating the flow near the
%well-bore by Equation \ref{eq:vol}, the transmissibility for this region can be
%found from the analytical solution to Equation \ref{eq:vol}:
%\begin{equation}
 %T_w=\frac{c K \cdot h}{ln(\frac{r_e}{r_w})},
 %\label{eq:Tw}
%\end{equation} where $c$ is a unit conversion constant, $h$ is the medium
%thickness, $K$ is the medium rock permeability, and $r_{w}$ is the well radius.
%Here, we assume that the well is completed and connected in the entire thickness
%of the cell $h$ and there is no skin effect in the well. The Equation
%\ref{eq:Tw} can be extended to model wells with partial completions and skins.
%$r_{e}$ in Equation \ref{eq:Tw} is estimated from Peaceman formula and can be
%related to the cell geometry:
%\begin{equation}
%r_e =  0.28\frac{\left[
%\delta_x^2(\frac{K_y}{K_x})^{\frac{1}{2}}+\delta_y^2(\frac{K_x}{K_y})^{\frac{1}{
%2}}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}}{(\frac{K_y}{K_x})^{\frac{1}{4}}+(\frac{K_x}{K_y})^{
%\frac{1}{4}}}.
%\label{eq:rinf} 
%\end{equation} Here, $K_x$ and $K_y$ are the permeabilities in $X$ and $Y$
%directions and $\delta_x$ and $\delta_y$ are the cell sizes in these directions.
%This equation assumes a vertical well and a diagonal permeability tensor. It can
%be modified for more general cases.
%
%\subsection{Flow scenarios}
%
%All of the realizations have dimensions of
%$3~\mbox{km}~\times~9~\mbox{km}~\times~80~\mbox{m}$, which is enough to capture
%variations in the designed geological features. While the volume of the
%realizations is large enough to capture major parts of the injected volume, the
%pressure disturbance imposed by the injector can go beyond this
%scale. To compensate for the size, we choose hydrostatics boundary conditions
%for the models. The open boundaries are modeled by considering a huge pore
%volume for the outer cells in the model that represent the boundary. Figure
%\ref{fig:BDRY} shows the boundary condition defined in the model. 
%
%The choice of open boundary is not valid in domains that are bounded by structural seals. In fact, for the close and semi-close domains the pressure is a main control on the storage capacity along with other parameters. We assume open boundaries, and the results of our study can change significantly by choosing different boundary condition. On the other hand, representing the boundary by a larg pore volumes on the outer closed cells makes the pressure to relax earlier than it does in a large infinte domain. Therefore, the pressure responses in our study, which are already extreme in many cases due to heterogeneity, can be magnified when it is run in huge sized models.
%
%We consider the injection of $20\%$ of the total model pore volume (excluding the large volumes at the boundaries), which amounts to $40~\mbox{MM m}^3$. This volume is injected into realizations
%in three different scenarios. In the first scenario, the injection is forced to
%finish in
%$30~\mbox{years}$ and the pressure in the system is allowed to rise
%unlimitedly. Linear relative permeability functions are considered in this
%scenario. The purpose of the first scenario is to examine the flow distribution
%in
%the medium influenced by geological heterogeneity. Linear assumption for
%relative permeabilities is taken to speed up the flow within the medium. The
%relative permeability curvature has shown a significant influence on the
%pressure behavior in the  aquifer. 
%
%In the second scenario, the injector operates with the same fixed rate as in the
%first scenario and the relative permeability curves are chosen to be quadratic
%functions. Quadratic relative permeability curves cause lower flow mobility in
%the medium compared to the linear function, and by forcing the injector with a
%fixed volumetric rate of injection, the pressure rises significantly in the
%aquifer. This leads us to the third injection scenario, where the injector is
%controlled by pressure rather than volumetric rate. Thus, injection time is
%variable depending on the injectivity of the medium.
%
%Only one injector is considered in the study. With one injector, it is easier to
%study the flow behavior and the plume development within the medium. The
%injector is
%located in the flank and to increase the sweep efficiency for the
%up-moving $\mbox{CO}_2$ plume, the injector is completed only in the lower part
%of
%the aquifer. The injector location and the completed layers are fixed for all of
%the realizations. The studies here aim to identify the influence of uncertainty
%on injectivity and fixing a place for injection helps in achieving this goal. As mentioned earlier, injectivity is a big player in the success of the operations. Near wellbore uncertainty might be less than the larger scale in the domain, but yet requires costly operation data aquisition. Fixing the location of the well serves specifiying the probability of having a feasible injectivity in different heterogeneities.
%
%There are few locations of distorted geometries in the faulted realizations that
%may be considered as structural traps for the injected $\mbox{CO}_2$. The
%topography in the SAIGUP realizations is simple and does not cover the
%variational space to be used in a sensitivity analysis. The slight inclination
%in the structural geometry of the medium, from the flank up to the crest, leads
%the injected $\mbox{CO}_2$  to accumulate in the crest and below the faulted
%side of the aquifer.The structural trapping due to variational morphology is
%studied in IGEMS, which is a sister project to MatMora (for example, see
%\cite{syversveenstudy}). 
%
%In a homogeneous medium, we expect the $\mbox{CO}_2$ to accumulate under the
%cap-rock. A small fraction of the injected $\mbox{CO}_2$ will escape through the
%open boundary near the injection well and the rest of it will stay within the
%medium in two forms that we refer to as  mobile and residual volumes. As
%the $\mbox{CO}_2$ moves through the rock, part of it stays in the smaller pores
%by capillary trapping process and can not be discharged by brine. The other
%parts move through the larger pores and can be displaced by water in an
%imbibition process. This volume is called mobile. As we are interested in
%storing the $\mbox{CO}_2$ permanently and safely, increasing the trapped volume
%is in line with the objective of minimizing the leakage risk and maximizing the
%storage capacity. Likewise, the more mobile volume of $\mbox{CO}_2$ exists in
%the medium, the more will be the risk of leakage.

%\end{figure}
%
%Defining the boundary condition of the aquifer of interest can influence the
%flow behavior in the system. One advantage of aquifers for carbon storage is the
%availability of large aquifers to provide the required accommodation space.
%Computational costs make that more feasible to model the flow locally and in the
%part of the aquifer that is going through more pronounced changes in flow
%behavior. Therefor, we can choose the boundaries of the model inside the aquifer
%in a volume that is containing the injection wells and the areas effected by
%them. Hydrostatic open boundary condition is a choice for the system boundaries
%to include the aquifer parts that fall outside the boundaries (Fig.
%\ref{fig:bkw}).
%
%The underground network of aquifer systems can be connected via geological
%channeling and conductive features. Some aquifers might be active and connected
%to the surface and expand in volume by variations in water influx due to 
%seasonal rains. This can impose an external force on the system boundaries
%considered in a storage problem. Fig. \ref{fig:bkw} shows the water influx
%through the boundaries of the system due to external aquifer activities. We
%consider the external support by imposing a higher pressure than the hydrostatic
%pressure on the boundary of the model.

%\subsection{Flow responses}
%
%The primary unknowns in the flow model are the $\mbox{CO}_2$ pressure
%and the saturation distribution at different times. From the simulation
%output, we can derive quantities that
%address the feasibility of $\mbox{CO}_2$ injection,
%these quantities include a number of flow responses related to the $\mbox{CO}_2$
%injection and migration problems. Each of these responses are directly or
%indirectly a measure of success for the operation within a specific realization.
%In the following, we give a brief description of each of them:
%
%\textbf{\textit{Boundary fluxes:}} The flux out of open boundaries is a measure
%of sweep efficiency for the
%CO$_2$ plume. Channeling can lead to early CO$_2$ breakthrough at boundaries and
%we prefer cases with less out-fluxes through open boundaries. The out-flux
%through the down open boundary, which is closer to the injector, is a potential
%loss for the injected volume. After the injection stops, some of the CO$_2$ that
%has left the domain comes in again due to gravity segregation effect. 
%
%\textbf{\textit{Total mobile and residual $\mbox{CO}_2$ volume:}}
%If the CO$_2$ saturation is below the critical value, it will be immobile in the
%bulk flow, although not in the molecular sense. Less mobile CO$_2$ means less
%risk of leakage and more residual volumes (with saturations less than the
%critical) resulting from a more efficient volume sweep as preferable. We use
%critical saturation of 0.2 for both water and CO$_2$. During injection time the
%flow process is mainly drainage but after injection imbibition also happens and
%increases the residual trapped CO$_2$. 
%
%\begin{figure}[thb]

  %%
  %\caption{Mobile and residual CO$_2$ volume.}
  %\label{fig:MobRes}
%%
%\end{figure}
%
%\textbf{\textit{Total number of $\mbox{CO}_2$ plumes and largest plume:}} To
%estimate the risk of leakage from the cap-rock, we assume that all mobile
%CO$_2$ connected to a leakage point will escape out of the reservoir. Hence, it
%is preferable if the total mobile CO$_2$ volume is split into smaller plumes
%rather than forming a big mobile plume. Though the area exposed to potential
%leakage points will increase by splitting the plume, yet the volume reduction is
%overtaking the area effect. We looked at the largest plume size, the number of
%plumes, and other statistical parameters.

%
%\textbf{\textit{Average aquifer pressure:}} Average aquifer pressure is one of
%the most important responses to be
%considered. The pressure response in general shows a sharp jump at the start of
%injection and a declining trend during the injection and plume migration.  
%
%As soon as the injection starts, a pulse of pressure goes through the
%medium, introducing
%a pressure buildup in the aquifer. When the pressure wave reaches the open
%boundary, the aquifer pressure starts declining to a level maintained by the
%injector. When the injector stops operation, the pressure support will be
%removed and the pressure drops and declines until it reaches equilibrium.
%
%\textbf{\textit{Leakage risk:}} During injection operation the foremost
%important issue is the aquifer pressure
%which as discussed earlier may lead to fractures in the cap-rock. On the other
%hand, the cap-rock break depends on lithology and sealing thickness and differs
%from point to point. Some weaker locations can be the most probable to
%break and start leaking if any mobile CO$_2$ exists there.
%
%Geo-mechanical modeling of aquifer combined with flow modeling in the medium are
%very costly to be used in uncertainty assessment processes. To avoid expensive
%computations, the idea in this thesis is to model the possible
%breakings on the cap-rock (considering the stress stream in the medium) by
%introducing a probability measure on the cap-rock. This measure can be used to
%evaluate different cases for their risk of leakage, considering the CO$_2$
%distribution under the cap-rock. 
%
%Here, we define the probability of leakage as a measure on the cap-rock that
%assigns a value to each point of the cap-rock, modeling the relative weakness of
%the cap-rock and the medium at that point. If for example both the cap-rock and
%the aquifer are continuous homogeneous layers with constant thickness, then the
%point of cap-rock that sits on the highest point of the injection slice can be
%the most probable place for leakage in case of dramatic pressure increase in the
%well: the stress stream is more in the injection slice and the CO$_2$
%accumulation occurs on the topmost part of the mentioned slice. Then one may
%consider a 2D-Gaussian probability distribution on the cap-rock, centered above
%the injection slice.
%
%If the medium is heterogeneous or tilted, the injected CO$_2$ may be distributed
%in different number and sizes of plumes below the cap-rock. Therefore, in
%addition to the probability of breaking for each point of cap-rock, one must
%consider the CO$_2$ connected volume that is attached to that point. 
%
%Since we have neither the cap-rock model nor the geo-mechanical properties of
%the SAIGUP models, we use a simple 2D-Gaussian leakage probability distribution
%centered at a point on the crest which is in the same slice as the injection
%point (Fig. \ref{fig:SLR}). We calculate the probability of each cell in the top
%layer and using the simulation results for the case, we weight it by the CO$_2$
%saturation of that cell and the plume size that the cell is attached to.
%Summing up the values of the topmost cells, we assign a single number to the
%case which we call leakage risk of the case. One may weight the case risk value
%with the average pressure in the system, such that higher pressure gives a
%bigger weight.

%Results are discussed by comparing all cases in plots. However, the conclusions are made based on detailed flow study in some picked cases. For example, Figures \ref{fig:Kz} to \ref{fig:FOSEOI} show the rock properties and \coo distribution in the domain at end of injection and end of simulation in two different cases. The heterogeneity description of the selected cases, called A and B, is given in Table \ref{tab:AaB}.
%
%\coo distribution in Figures \ref{fig:COEOI} and \ref{fig:COEOS} show that heterogeneity in case B has enhanced the lateral flow compared to case B. Direction of the flow can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:FOSEOI}. It is clear that heterogeneity can influence the imbibition and drainage process during and after injection. This, in turn, impacts the residual trapping process.

%\section{Sensitivity and risk analysis}
%\label{sec:StochasticAnalysis}
%
%Mathematical models developed to approximate the injected $\mbox{CO}_{2}$ in the
%storage sites consist of several steps, including the determination of
%parameters which are the most influential on the model outputs. Sensitivity
%analysis can serve as a guide to any further use of the model.
%
%In the initial sensitivity analysis performed on geological uncertain
%parameters of our studies, we use the large number of detailed flow
%simulations and measure the variability of model responses with respect to each
%level of the uncertain parameters.
%
%We can obtain histograms of response $\Gamma$  for three different levels of
%parameter $\alpha$ (i.e., low, medium, and high) by performing simulations over
%all geological realizations. Measuring the mean response value on
%each histogram results in an average for all cases with a fixed level for
%parameter $\alpha$. Having three average points for low, medium,
%and high levels of parameter $\alpha$, a line can be fitted to those points 
%that approximates the trend of variations of response $\Gamma$ versus the
%increase in levels of para $\alpha$.
%
%Assuming an equal probability for each level, the model output variations are
%examined by looking at each response at two important simulation times, i.e.,
%end of injection and end of simulation. In order to study the input variations
%over a higher resolution, demands for a fast flow modeler. We use a response 
%surface method that is explained in the next section in details.

%\subsection{Stochastic analysis}
%
%Complicated physical phenomenon must be modeled as a stochastic process.
%Uncertainty reduction in different part of modeling requires a better
%understanding and description of input parameters and dependency rules within
%the system. Parameters can be ranked in the order of their influence on the
%model output. Knowing the most influential parameters helps in treating the
%stochastic nature of the process.
%
%Sensitivity analysis serves in identification and evaluation of important model
%parameters. The European commissions and the United States environment
%protection agency recommend using sensitivity analysis in the context of
%extended compact assessment for uncertainty reduction strategies and policy
%making \cite{saltelli4global}.
%
%As discussed in the earlier sections, various sources of uncertainties are
%embedded within $\mbox{CO}_{2}$ storage modeling and operations. The devotion of
%our research has been on geological uncertainty and its consequences. The
%procedure used here to identify the relative importance of uncertain geological
%parameters via sensitivity analysis and the corresponding risk assessment is a
%general work-flow that can be applied to any type of uncertainties in the model
%inputs.
%
%Our research continues by employing a stochastic response surface method that
%approximates the flow responses by projecting them on high-dimensional
%polynomials. In particular, we use arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansions,
%which consists of orthogonal polynomial bases that are constructed  according
%to the uncertainties in the input parameters. The approach is flexible with
%respect to the quantification of probabilities for uncertain parameters and can
%be applied in studies with limited knowledge of probabilities. 
%
%The reduced model approximated by aPC is considerably faster than the original
%detailed one, and thus it  provides a promising start point for global
%sensitivity analysis and probabilistic risk assessment. Variance based global
%sensitivity analysis methods have shown success in non-linear and complex
%problems\cite{reuter2008global}.
%
%The system can be decomposed into approximating functions of input parameters,
%and this makes it easy to implement methods based on variance. The bottle-neck
%of variance-based approaches can be their computational costs. In our case, the
%variance in output responses can be set equal to the variance of polynomial
%components calculated for each input parameters. Polynomials are relatively
%very fast and this makes it efficient to implement a variance based sensitivity
%analysis. Furthermore, the fact that the response surface has know polynomial
%properties simplifies the approach significantly.
%Finally, the speed of polynomial approximation makes it feasible to perform an
%intensive probabilistic risk assessment via Monte-Carlo process over high
%resolution input variation.
%
%\subsection{Arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion}
%
%Statistical accuracy of a Monte-Carlo process is highly sensitive to the
%resolution of variational inputs. A response surface method assisting a
%Monte-Carlo procedure must be constructed on a dense Cartesian grid, which will
%be computationally demanding. We explore an alternative method which only
%requires a minimum number of model evaluations to construct the approximating
%response surface. The approach we use is based on the aPC as described in
%\cite{oladyshkin2011concept}. The main idea is to construct the approximating
%response surface by projecting the response on orthogonal polynomial bases
%within uncertain parameter space . Therefore, uncertainty of input parameters is
%involved in the process from the initial steps of the work-flow. This approach
%is an advanced statistical regress on method that offers an efficient and
%accurate way of including non-l near effects in stochastic analysis, see e.g.,
%\cite{Zhang_Lu_2004_JCP,foo_pcm_JCP2010,
%Fajraoui_al_2011_WRR}. The method i examined for accuracy and one attractive
%feature of PCE is the high-order approximation of error propagation as well as
%its computational speed \cite{oladyshkinintegrative} when compared to
%Monte-Carlo processes.
%
%Earlier PCE techniques put the restriction of specified types of uncertainty
%distribution functions to be used in the work-flow. In contrast, the arbitrary
%polynomial chaos (aPC) is flexible to accommodate for a wide range of data
%distribution \cite{oladyshkin2011concept}. The aPC can work even in cases with
%limited uncertainty information reduced in a few statistical moments of samples.
%They can be specified either analytically (as probability density, cumulative
%distribution functions), numerically as histograms, or as raw data sets. In
%terms of performance, the aPC approach shows an improved convergence applied to
%input distribution that fall outside the range of classical PCE.
%
%In general, an approximation of system response $\Gamma$, can be written as a
%functionality of uncertain input parameters $\Theta$:
%
%\begin{equation}
  %\Gamma\approx\Upsilon(\Theta).
  %\label{eq:1}
%\end{equation} 
%%
%Uncertainty of input parameters $\Theta$ can be represented by mapping $h$ from
%random variable space $xi$ to random input space $\Theta$%
%\begin{equation}
  %\Theta=h(\xi).
  %\label{eq:rand}
%\end{equation} As discussed earlier, $h$ can be an analytical or numerical
%representation.
%%
%Approximation \ref{eq:1} can be expressed in the parametric mathematical form.
%We use a polynomial expression to approximate the flow responses. This
%polynomial consists of coefficients that do not necessarily have a direct
%physical interpretation. Instead, we must define these coefficient such that
%the prediction by our polynomial functional matches some available realistic
%responses. These responses must be obtained either from real data measurements
%or via detailed flow modeling tools. This type of approximation is data-driven
%and we can rewrite approximation in \ref{eq:1} as follows:
%
%\begin{equation}
  %\Gamma\approx\Upsilon(\Theta)=\upsilon(\Theta,\alpha).
  %\label{eq:parm}
%\end{equation} In this relation, $\Theta$ is the input parameters and $\alpha$
%is in the data driven parameter space, which represents the dependency between
%input and output of the system. First, we specify $\alpha$. Then given
%$\Theta$, the responses $\Gamma$ can be estimated. In many practical problems,
%input parameters are expressed in terms of random variables and a functional
%form is defined to quantify the system responses. This functional expression
%can be in different forms, from simple linear mapping to very complicated
%non-linear forms.
%
%The aPC approach involves the uncertainty of input parameters in constructing
%the polynomial bases. The responses of the system can be expanded into the
%space of these bases. This expression is specified by constant coefficient
%$c_i$:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\Gamma\approx\underset{i=1}{\overset{n_c}{\sum}}c_{i}\Pi_{i}(\Theta).
  %\label{eq:exp}
%\end{equation} Here, $n_c$ is the number of expansion terms, $c_{i}$ are the
%expansion coefficients, and
%$\Pi_{i}$ are the multi-dimensional polynomials for the variables
%$\Theta$, $\Theta=[\theta_{1},...,\theta_{n}]$. The number $n_c$ of unknown
%coefficients $c_{i}$ depends on the degree $d$ of the approximating polynomial,
%and the number of considered parameters $n$:
%%
%\begin{equation}
 %n_c=\frac{(d+n)!}{d!\times n!}.
 %\label{eq:np}
%\end{equation}
%%
%%---------------------------
%
%%##################################
%
%
%
%Polynomials $\Pi_i$ in the Expansion \ref{eq:exp} consist of polynomial bases
%$P_l$, with $l$ ranging from zero up to the approximation degree $d$. These
%bases are orthogonal, i.e., every pair of non-identical bases fulfill the
%following condition:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\int_{I\in\Omega}\omega
%P_{l}P_{m}d\tau(\Theta)=\delta_{lm},\label{eq:orth}\end{equation} where $\omega$
%is a weight function, $\delta$ is the Kronecker delta function, and $\tau$ is
%the measure for input variable space. We choose the weight to be one, i.e.,
%$\omega\equiv1$. 
%
%According to \cite{oladyshkin2011concept}, the orthogonal polynomial basis
%satisfying Equation~(\ref{eq:orth}) can be obtained from the solution of the
%following linear system of equations: 
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
%\mu_{0} & \mu_{1} & ... & \mu_{k}\\
%\mu_{1} & \mu_{2} & ... & \mu_{k+1}\\
%... & ... & ... & ...\\
%\mu_{k-1} & \mu_{k} & ... & \mu_{2k-1}\\
%0 & 0 & ... & 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
%P_{0}^{(k)}\\
%P_{1}^{(k)}\\
%...\\
%P_{k-1}^{(k)}\\
%P_{k}^{(k)}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
%0\\
%0\\
%...\\
%0\\
%1\end{array}\right],\label{eq:orthsys}\end{equation}.
%Here, $\mu_{k}$ is the $k^{th}$ non-central (raw) statistical moment of random
%input variable, which is defined as:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%\mu_{k}=\int_{\Theta\in\Omega}\Theta^{k}d\tau(\Theta).\label{eq:mnt}
%\end{equation}
%%
%Thus, arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion base on Equation~\ref{eq:orthsys}
%only
%demands the existence of a finite number of moments, and does not require the
%exact knowledge or even existence of probability density functions. An
%interesting aspect is that only moments up to twice the order of expansion
%matter. This means, that there is no need for any kind of assumptions for data
%probability distribution leading to subjectivity artifacts as discussed earlier.
%
%The PCE techniques are divided into intrusive
%\cite{Ghanem1993,Matthies2005,Xiu2003} and non-intrusive
%\cite{Keese2003,Isukapalli1998,nLi2007,oladyshkinintegrative} approaches.
%Intrusive techniques require modifications in the system of governing
%equations. In some cases, this can end up in semi-analytical methods that are
%used for simpler stochastic analysis studies (e.g., stochastic Galerkin
%method). However, the intrusive approaches can be very complex and analytically
%cumbersome and can not be implemented for industrial applications. In contrast
%to intrusive techniques, the non-intrusive methods are vastly used in practical
%studies. These methods do not require any symbolic manipulations of the
%governing equations. The sparse quadrature and the probabilistic collocation
%method (PCM, \cite{nLi2007,oladyshkinintegrative}) are among the non-intrusive
%technique. In a simple sense, PCM can be considered as a mathematically
%optimized interpolation of model output for various parameter sets. The
%polynomial interpolation is based on minimal model evaluations in optimally
%chosen set of parameters that are called collocation points. Hence, the
%challenge in these techniques is to find a balance between accuracy and speed
%to evaluate the uncertainty in the physical processes.
%
%The collocation formulation has the advantage of treating the model as a
%black-box. This formulation requires the corresponding output to be known in
%the collocation set of input parameters obtained from any acceptable mapping
%between input and output in the system.
%
%According to \cite{Villadsen1978}, the optimal choice of collocation
%points corresponds to the roots of the polynomial of one degree higher ($d+1$)
%than the order used in the chaos expansion ($d$). This strategy is based on the
%theory of Gaussian integration (e.g., \cite{Abramowitz1965}). 
%
%For multi-parameter analysis, the full tensor grid of available points from the
%original integration rule is $(d+1)^n$, which is larger than the necessary
%number
%$M$ of collocation points. This might be used for low-order
%($1^{st}$, $2^{nd}$) analysis of limited number of parameters. However, for
%large number of parameters and high order of polynomial approximations, the
%full grid becomes computationally cumbersome. In the collocation approach,
%minimal tensor of grid point set is chosen that is a scarce set of collocation
%points that are chosen from the most probable regions based on the parameter
%probability distributions (See
%\cite{nLi2007,oladyshkinintegrative,oladyshkin2011concept}). This way the
%modeler can extract a lot of information in the main range of the parameter
%distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:col}).
%
%We implement the probabilistic collocation method for computing the
%coefficients $c_i$ in Equation \ref{eq:exp}. The weighted-residual method in
%the random space is defined as \cite{nLi2007}:
%
%\begin{figure}
  %\centering
  %\includegraphics[width=0.65 \linewidth]{./figurer/col} 
  %%
  %\caption{Collocation points are combined in different uncertainty directions
%such that the total probability in all directions is maximized.}
  %\label{fig:col}
%%
%\end{figure}
%
%\begin{equation}
%\int\left[\Gamma-\underset{i=1}{\overset{n_c}{\sum}}c_{i}\Pi_{i}
%(\Theta))w(\Theta)p(\Theta)\right]d\tau=0,\label{eq:residual}
%\end{equation}
%where $w(\Theta)$ is the weighting function and $p(\Theta)$ is the joint
%probability density function of $\Theta$. By substituting the weight function in
%Equation~\ref{eq:residual} with  Delta function, the equation reduces to
%
%\begin{equation}
 %\Gamma_{c}-\underset{i=1}{\overset{n_c}{\sum}c_{i}}\Pi_{i}(\Theta_{c})=0.
%\label{eq:solution}
%\end{equation} In this equation, $\Gamma_c$ and $\Theta_c$ are the responses and
%input parameters in the collocation points. Having the $\Theta_c$ chosen based
%on the probability distributions of input parameters, and $\Gamma_c$ from the
%minimal model evaluations on $\Theta_c$, we can solve Equation
%\ref{eq:solution} and find the coefficients $c_i$.
%
%\subsection{Sensitivity analysis}
%\label{Section:SA}
%
%Sensitivity analysis helps in understanding the degree of dependency of system
%responses to the input parameters. When the input parameters are uncertain in
%value, the model predictions will consist of uncertainties that must be
%eliminated for a robust and precise prediction. Therefore, sensitivity analysis
%can be useful both in optimizing the system performance and in studying the
%variation in performance coming from the stochastic nature of the system.
%
%Global sensitivity analysis covers the entire variational space for uncertain
%parameters, while other methods, like the gradient-based methods, are limited
%in the scope influence of the parameters. 
%
%Variance-based methods are very popular among different types of sensitivity
%analysis methods. Variance-based methods provide global sensitivity and work
%for general non-linear problems. When the response is decomposed into simpler
%components (for instance, polynomial bases), it is easier to decompose the
%unconditional variance in the output into terms due to individual parameters
%and the interaction between them. It is possible then to rank the input
%parameters based on their contribution to the output variance
%\cite{saltelli2007global,reuter2008global}.
%
%Following the linear sensitivity analysis performed initially in the study on
%the extensive detailed simulations, we tackle the global sensitivity analysis
%based on the aPC technique. This approach is well described in
%\cite{oladyshkin2011concept,
%OladNowakBarros_AWR2011}. Morris method \cite{Morris1991} considers a uniform
%importance of input parameters within predefined intervals. We use a weighted
%global sensitivity in a more flexible approach accounting for arbitrary bounds
%and parameters with different importance defined by weighting functions. The
%big advantage of aPC-based sensitivity methods is their low computational costs
%for obtaining global sensitivity analysis. The aPC based-method
%places the parameter sets for model evaluation at an optimized spacing in
%parameter space. This can be interpreted as fitting polynomials to the model
%response. These polynomials approximate the model over the entire parameter
%space in a weighted least-square sense. This is more beneficial to computing a
%tangent or local second derivatives (compare FORM, SORM methods, e.g.,
%\cite{Jang1994}) that approximate the model well just around one point in the
%parameter space.
 %
%As an advantage, in variance based methods one can work with arbitrary system as
%a black-box and calculations are based on inputs and outputs only. More
%recent works are concerned about expediting calculation pace
%\cite{crestaux2009polynomial,oladyshkin2011concept, OladNowakBarros_AWR2011}.
%The idea is to replace the system with an approximating function which gives
%benefits in sensitivity calculations, because it is easy to relate the output
%variances to
%the input variables. 
%
%We expand the variance of output solution into
%components. Assume that we break the system output into components:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\Gamma=\Gamma_{0}+\underset{_{i}}{\sum}\Gamma_{i}+\underset{_{i}}{\sum}\underset
%{_{j>i}}{\sum}\Gamma_{ij}+...\label{eq:comp}\end{equation}
%
%A single index shows dependency to a specific input variable, whereas more than
%one index shows interaction of input variables. If we consider input vector
%$\Theta$ to be of $n$ components $\theta_{i}$ for $i=1,..,n$, then
%$\Gamma_{i}=f_{i}(\theta_{i})$ and $\Gamma_{ij}=f_{ij}(\theta_{i},\theta_{j})$.
%In practice, we consider a finite number of terms in Equation~(\ref{eq:comp}).
 %The first order sensitivity index, so called Sobol index, is defined as follows
%\cite{saltelli2007global}:
%
%\begin{equation}
%S_{i}=\frac{\mbox{V}[\mbox{E}(\Gamma\mid\theta_{i})]}{\mbox{V}(\Gamma)},
%\label{eq:sob1}\end{equation} where $\mbox{E}(\Gamma\mid\theta_{i})$ is the
%conditional
%expectation of output $\Gamma$ given $\theta_{i}$ and $\mbox{V}$ is the variance
%operator. Since $\theta_{i}$ can be fixed at any value in its uncertainty
%interval, each of those values produce a distinct expectation
%$\mbox{E}(\Gamma\mid\theta_{i})$. Equation \ref{eq:sob1} is a measure for
%variations of these expectations, which indicates the direct contribution of
%parameter $\theta_i$ in the output variance. For more than one index, a
%higher-order Sobol index can be defined as:\begin{equation}
%S_{ij}=\frac{\mbox{V}[\mbox{E}(\Gamma\mid\theta_{i},\theta_{j})]-\mbox{V}[\mbox{
%E}(\Gamma\mid\theta_{i})]-\mbox{V}[\mbox{E}(\Gamma\mid\theta_{j})]}{\mbox{V}
%(\Gamma)}.\label{eq:sob2}\end{equation} Here,
%$\mbox{V}[\mbox{E}(\Gamma\mid\theta_{i},\theta_{j})]$ is the variance of output
%expectations after fixing $\theta_{i}$ and $\theta_{j}$. This index represents
%significance of variation in output generated from uncertainty in input 
%variables together, i.e., the interaction of uncertain parameters. If we add all
%indices that contain variable $\theta_{i}$, the sum is called the total Sobol
%index:
%
%\begin{equation}
%S_{Ti}=S_{i}+\underset{_{j\neq i}}{\sum}S_{ij}+\underset{_{j\neq
%i}}{\sum}\underset{_{k\neq i}}{\sum}S_{ijk}+...\label{eq:totSob}\end{equation}
%
%To clarify the subject, we go through a simple analytical example given in
%\cite{arwade2010variance}. Suppose that the exact expression for response
%$\Gamma$ to be known and can be written as a polynomial with parameters
%$\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\theta_3$:
 %
%\begin{equation}
%\Gamma(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3) =
%{\theta_1}^2+{\theta_2}^4+{\theta_1}{\theta_2}+{\theta_2}{\theta_3}^4.
%\label{eq:SobExmple}\end{equation} The Sobol indices can be calculated from
%functions $F$ that are defined based on orthogonality condition used to
%decompose the solution and for input with Gaussian distribution $\Phi_n$ in
%uncertainty domain $R^n$ they are as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%F_0=\int_{R^n}\Gamma(\Theta) \Phi_n(\Theta) d\Theta,
%\label{eq:SobF0}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%F_i=\frac{\int_{R^{n-1}}\Gamma_{|_{\theta_i}}
%\Phi_{n-1}(\theta_{\sim i}) d\theta_{\sim i}}{\Phi_{1}(\theta_i)} - F_0,
%\label{eq:SobFi}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%F_{i,j}=\frac{\int_{R^{n-2}}\Gamma_{|_{\theta_i,\theta_j}}
%\Phi_{n-2}(\theta_{\sim i,\sim j}) d\theta_{\sim i} d\theta_{\sim
%j}}{\Phi_{2}(\theta_i,\theta_j)}-F_0-F_i(\theta_i)-F_j(\theta_j).
%\label{eq:SobFij}\end{equation} $\Gamma_{|_{\theta_i}}$ and
%$\Gamma_{|_{\theta_i,\theta_j}}$ are the $\Gamma$ values at fixed $theta_i$ and
%$\{\theta_i,\theta_j\}$ respectively. $\theta_{\sim i}$ is the vector of dummy
%variables corresponding to all but the component $\theta_i$ of uncertain
%parameters~$\Theta$.
%
%Let us denote the variances by $D$:
%\begin{equation}
%D=\mbox{V}[F(\Theta)]=\int F^2(\Theta) d\Theta-F_0,
%\label{eq:SobD}\end{equation} that can be decomposed into 
%\begin{equation}
%D_i=\int{F_i}^2(\theta_i) d\theta_i,
%\label{eq:SobDi}\end{equation} and
%\begin{equation} 
%D_{i,j}=\int{F_{ij}}^2(\theta_{i},\theta_{j}) d\theta_{i}d\theta_{j}.
%\label{eq:SobDij}\end{equation} Then the Sobol indices can be found from:
%\begin{equation} 
%S_i=\frac{D_i}{D},
%\label{eq:SiDi}\end{equation}
%\begin{equation} 
%S_{i,j}=\frac{D_{i,j}}{D}.
%\label{eq:SijDij}\end{equation} Finally, the total Sobol index can be found
%from Equation \ref{eq:totSob}. Applying the calculations of Equations
%\ref{eq:SobF0} to \ref{eq:SobDij} for our example (i.e., the expression in
%Equation \ref{eq:SobExmple}) we can obtain the following Sobol
%indices,
%assuming Gaussian distributions for the parameters over the interval $[0,1]$:
%
%\begin{tabular}{ccc}
%% \hline 
%$S_1=0.0005$ & $S_2=0.4281$ & $S_3=0.0000$ \\%\tabularnewline
%% \hline 
%% \hline 
%$S_{12}=0.0007$ &  $S_{13}=0.0000$ & $S_{23}=0.5708$\\ %\tabularnewline
%% \hline 
%% \hline 
%$S_{123}=0.0000$ & & %\tabularnewline
%% \hline 
%\end{tabular}\\
%and the total sobol indices are:\\
%\begin{tabular}{ccc}
%$S_{T1}= 0.0012$ & $S_{T2}= 0.9996$ & $S_{T3}= 0.5708$ 
%\end{tabular}.\\ The total Sobol index can be used as a sensitivity
%measure to rank parameters
%for their influence in the results variation. In this example, we can see that
%the ranking that the total Sobol indices suggests is consistent with what can
%be inferred directly from the simple expression in Equation \ref{eq:SobExmple}:
%$\theta_2$ is the most influential parameters, because it appears in two terms,
%and in one of them with a forth degree. Interactions are represented by two
%indices, and $S_{13}$ is zero, because there exist no term in Equation
%\ref{eq:SobExmple} that contains both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_3$.
%
%With known polynomial coefficients, Sobol indices are easy to calculate. When
%the number of parameters is large, it is possible to do initial sensitivity
%analysis with lower degree polynomials to filter out pertinent parameters. Then
%the analysis continues on the filtered parameters with a higher
%degree polynomial approximation.

%\subsection{Risk analysis}
%\label{Section:RA}
%
%The risk is the impact of uncertainty on objectives. Quantifying the risk
%requires calculating this impact, which consist of two parts: quantification of
%the uncertainty and evaluation of the system consequences. Risk $R$ of a process
%is quantitatively defined as the consequence $C$
%caused by the process multiplied by the probability $P$ of that consequence to
%happen:
%%
%\begin{equation}
%R=P\times C
%\label{eq:rsk}.\end{equation}
%%
%In the case of $\mbox{CO}_{2}$ injection into deep aquifers, the amount of
%$\mbox{CO}_{2}$ which stays mobile and undissolved in the medium for a time
%after injection can be considered as a consequence, bearing the potential of
%leakage up to the surface if exposed to a geological leakage point. The risk
%could be the expected amount of $\mbox{CO}_{2}$ that will leak through
%ill-plugged abandoned wells or cracks in the sealing rocks. 
%
%We consider looking at responses and the probability of them to happen. We
%initially examine this probability by drawing the histogram of response values
%obtained from detailed simulations on large number of realizations and
%corresponding to important time, like end of injection and end of simulation.
%Yet larger number of points in the uncertain parameter space are studied
%employing the data-driven aPC method, which requires a considerably short time
%for evaluating the responses. This way it is possible to perform an intensive
%Monte-Carlo process in a full tensor grid of input parameter variational space,
%resulting in a high resolution output probability distribution.

%\section{Implementation of work-flow}
%\label{sec:ImplementationWorkFlow}
%
%This thesis incorporated working with large number of realizations, various flow
%scenarios, and different procedures and softwares. While the study progresses,
%new ideas and challenges rises that require manipulation of parts of the
%work-flow. In order to achieve the defined goals of the research, an automated
%work-flow is required that connects different parts of the study and converts
%data type in-between them. This makes the study feasible in terms of saving time
%for any necessary modifications.
%
%MATLAB programming language is used for implementing the work-flow in this
%research. The main reason for this choice, apart from the rich facilities
%available within MATLAB toolboxes, is to use many functions within the 
%MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) \cite{lie2011open,mrst} available as
%free and
%open-source software in MATLAB language. For flow simulation a commercial
%software is used, which is a standard simulator for oil and gas industry and
%research. The simulator is using finite difference for flow modeling. 
%
%Figure \ref{fig:encl} shows the elements of the work-flow implemented by a large
%number of MATLAB functions. Functions from MRST at SINTEF and the stochastic
%tools of SIMTECH group in Stuttgart university are utilized and merged into the
%work-flow. The design is made such that the work-flow is flexible and general.
%Some research has been done by replacing the commercial simulator with in-house
%simulators at SINTEF, but the main study was performed using a commercial standard simulator. 
%
%One thing to notice in Figure  \ref{fig:encl} is the link between designing
%geological realizations and implementation of aPCE method. A normal procedure
%must start by finding the collocation points from the given geological
%uncertainty, and then based on those collocation points we design the
%geological realizations.
